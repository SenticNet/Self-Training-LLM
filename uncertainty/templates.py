        'document':"RNA editing (also RNA modification) is a molecular process through which some cells can make discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences within an RNA molecule after it has been generated by RNA polymerase. It occurs in all living organisms and is one of the most evolutionarily conserved properties of RNAs. RNA editing may include the insertion, deletion, and base substitution of nucleotides within the RNA molecule. RNA editing is relatively rare, with common forms of RNA processing (e.g. splicing, 5'-capping, and 3'-polyadenylation) not usually considered as editing. It can affect the activity, localization as well as stability of RNAs, and has been linked with human diseases.\n\nRNA editing has been observed in some tRNA, rRNA, mRNA, or miRNA molecules of eukaryotes and their viruses, archaea, and prokaryotes. RNA editing occurs in the cell nucleus, as well as within mitochondria and plastids. In vertebrates, editing is rare and usually consists of a small number of changes to the sequence of the affected molecules. In other organisms, such as squids, extensive editing (pan-editing) can occur; in some cases the majority of nucleotides in an mRNA sequence may result from editing. More than 160 types of RNA modifications have been described so far.\n\nRNA-editing processes show great molecular diversity, and some appear to be evolutionarily recent acquisitions that arose independently. The diversity of RNA editing phenomena includes nucleobase modifications such as cytidine (C) to uridine (U) and adenosine (A) to inosine (I) deaminations, as well as non-template nucleotide additions and insertions. RNA editing in mRNAs effectively alters the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein so that it differs from that predicted by the genomic DNA sequence.",

The painting represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with the Twelve Apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John – specifically the moment after Jesus announces that one of his apostles will betray him.[1] Its handling of space, mastery of perspective, treatment of motion and complex display of human emotion has made it one of the Western world's most recognizable paintings and among Leonardo's most celebrated works.[2] Some commentators consider it pivotal in inaugurating the transition into what is now termed the High Renaissance.\n\nThe work was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. In order to permit his inconsistent painting schedule and frequent revisions, it is painted with materials that allowed for regular alterations: tempera on gesso, pitch, and mastic. Due to the methods used, a variety of environmental factors, and intentional damage, little of the original painting remains today despite numerous restoration attempts, the last being completed in 1999. The Last Supper is Leonardo's largest work, aside from the Sala delle Asse. ",

The Mont Blanc massif is popular for outdoor activities like hiking, climbing, trail running, and winter sports like skiing and snowboarding. The most popular climbing route to the summit of Mont Blanc is the Goûter Route, which typically takes two days.\n\nThe three towns and their communes which surround Mont Blanc are Courmayeur in Aosta Valley, Italy; and Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and Chamonix in Haute-Savoie, France. The latter town was the site of the first Winter Olympics. A cable car ascends and crosses the mountain range from Courmayeur to Chamonix through the Col du Géant. The 11.6 km (7+1⁄4 mi) Mont Blanc Tunnel, constructed between 1957 and 1965, runs beneath the mountain and is a major transalpine transport route.\n\nMont Blanc and adjacent mountains in the massif are predominately formed from a large intrusion of granite (termed a batholith) which was forced up through a basement layer of gneiss and mica schists during the Variscan mountain-forming event of the late Palaeozoic period.

        "document": "Diabetes mellitus, often known simply as diabetes, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels.[10][11] Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to the hormone's effects.[12] Classic symptoms include thirst, polyuria, weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves.\n\nThe major types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2, though other forms also exist. The most common treatment for type 1 is insulin replacement therapy (insulin injections), while anti-diabetic medications (such as metformin and semaglutide) and lifestyle modifications can be used to manage type 2.\n\nThe classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are polyuria, thirst, and weight loss.[18] Several other non-specific signs and symptoms may also occur, including fatigue, blurred vision, and genital itchiness due to Candida infection.[18] About half of affected individuals may also be asymptomatic.[18] Type 1 presents abruptly following a pre-clinical phase, while type 2 has a more insidious onset; patients may remain asymptomatic for many years.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that occurs most commonly in type 1, but may also occur in type 2 if it has been longstanding or if the individual has significant β-cell dysfunction.[20] Excessive production of ketone bodies leads to signs and symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, the smell of acetone in the breath, deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing, and in severe cases decreased level of consciousness.",

        "document": "The fall of the Western Roman Empire, also called the fall of the Roman Empire or the fall of Rome, was the loss of central political control in the Western Roman Empire, a process in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided between several successor polities. The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control over its Western provinces; modern historians posit factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the emperors, the internal struggles for power, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from invading barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. Climatic changes and both endemic and epidemic disease drove many of these immediate factors. In 395, after winning two destructive civil wars, Theodosius I died. He left a collapsing field army, and the Empire divided between the warring ministers of his two incapable sons. Goths and other non-Romans became a force that could challenge either part of the Empire. Further barbarian groups crossed the Rhine and other frontiers. The armed forces of the Western Empire became few and ineffective, and despite brief recoveries under able leaders, central rule was never again effectively consolidated.\n\nBy 476, the position of Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military, political, or financial power, and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman. Barbarian kingdoms had established their own power in much of the area of the Western Empire. In 476, the Germanic barbarian king Odoacer deposed the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire in Italy, Romulus Augustulus, and the Senate sent the imperial insignia to the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno.",

Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form.[2][3][4] These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The overall uniformity of the universe, known as the flatness problem, is explained through cosmic inflation: a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the earliest moments. However, physics currently lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity that can successfully model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang.\n\nCrucially, these models are compatible with the Hubble–Lemaître law—the observation that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from Earth. Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the models describe an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning (typically named \"the Big Bang singularity\").[5] In 1964 the CMB was discovered, which convinced many cosmologists that the competing steady-state model of cosmic evolution was falsified,[6] since the Big Bang models predict a uniform background radiation caused by high temperatures and densities in the distant past. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang event, which is now essentially universally accepted.[7] Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at an estimated 13.787±0.020 billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe.",

Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Despite a short mainstream career spanning only three years, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to the major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, Nevermind was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is credited for ending the dominance of hair metal.\n\nCharacterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, In Utero (1993).

        "document": "Keynesian economics (/ˈkeɪnziən/ KAYN-zee-ən; sometimes Keynesianism, named after British economist John Maynard Keynes) are the various macroeconomic theories and models of how aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) strongly influences economic output and inflation.\n\nKeynesian economists generally argue that aggregate demand is volatile and unstable and that, consequently, a market economy often experiences inefficient macroeconomic outcomes, including recessions when demand is too low and inflation when demand is too high. Further, they argue that these economic fluctuations can be mitigated by economic policy responses coordinated between government and central bank. In particular, fiscal policy actions taken by the government and monetary policy actions taken by the central bank, can help stabilize economic output, inflation, and unemployment over the business cycle.[3] Keynesian economists generally advocate a regulated market economy – predominantly private sector, but with an active role for government intervention during recessions and depressions.\n\nKeynesian economics, as part of the neoclassical synthesis, served as the standard macroeconomic model in the developed nations during the later part of the Great Depression, World War II, and the post-war economic expansion (1945–1973). It was developed in part to attempt to explain the Great Depression and to help economists understand future crises. It lost some influence following the oil shock and resulting stagflation of the 1970s.[6] Keynesian economics was later redeveloped as New Keynesian economics, becoming part of the contemporary new neoclassical synthesis, that forms current-day mainstream macroeconomics.[7] The advent of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 sparked renewed interest in Keynesian policies by governments around the world.",

A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to the Sun's, while its volume is comparable to Earth's.\n\nWhite dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star or black hole. After the hydrogen-fusing period of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends, such a star will expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple-alpha process. If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon (around 1 billion K), an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After such a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula, it will leave behind a core, which is the remnant white dwarf. Usually, white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen (CO white dwarf). If the mass of the progenitor is between 7 and 9 solar masses (M☉), the core temperature will be sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon, in which case an oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg or ONe) white dwarf may form.[6] Stars of very low mass will be unable to fuse helium; hence, a helium white dwarf may form by mass loss in binary systems.",

Leibniz notation, named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, is represented as the ratio of two differentials, whereas prime notation is written by adding a prime mark. Higher order notations represent repeated differentiation, and they are usually denoted in Leibniz notation by adding superscripts to the differentials, and in prime notation by adding additional prime marks.

        'document':"Vector calculus or vector analysis is a branch of mathematics concerned with the differentiation and integration of vector fields, primarily in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The term vector calculus is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader subject of multivariable calculus, which spans vector calculus as well as partial differentiation and multiple integration. Vector calculus plays an important role in differential geometry and in the study of partial differential equations. It is used extensively in physics and engineering, especially in the description of electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, and fluid flow.\n\nVector calculus was developed from the theory of quaternions by J. Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside near the end of the 19th century, and most of the notation and terminology was established by Gibbs and Edwin Bidwell Wilson in their 1901 book, Vector Analysis. In its standard form using the cross product, vector calculus does not generalize to higher dimensions, but the alternative approach of geometric algebra, which uses the exterior product, does.\n\n A scalar field associates a scalar value to every point in a space. The scalar is a mathematical number representing a physical quantity. Examples of scalar fields in applications include the temperature distribution throughout space, the pressure distribution in a fluid, and spin-zero quantum fields (known as scalar bosons), such as the Higgs field. These fields are the subject of scalar field theory.",

        'document':"In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations.  A definite integral computes the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function; in this case, they are also called indefinite integrals.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integration to differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known; differentiation and integration are inverse operations.\n\nAlthough methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into infinitesimally thin vertical slabs. In the early 20th century, Henri Lebesgue generalized Riemann's formulation by introducing what is now referred to as the Lebesgue integral; it is more general than Riemann's in the sense that a wider class of functions are Lebesgue-integrable.",

It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space). For instance, if X is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss ('the experiment'), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 (1 in 2 or 1/2) for X = heads, and 0.5 for X = tails (assuming that the coin is fair). More commonly, probability distributions are used to compare the relative occurrence of many different random values.\n\nProbability distributions can be defined in different ways and for discrete or for continuous variables. Distributions with special properties or for especially important applications are given specific names.",

It posits that the universe began as an extremely hot and dense point about 13.8 billion years ago, then rapidly expanded and cooled, giving rise to the formation of galaxies, stars, and eventually, all known matter and energy. This model explains the observed distribution of galaxies and the cosmic background radiation as remnants of this initial expansion. The theory predicts a dynamic universe, where galaxies move away from each other, a phenomenon that was observed through the redshift of galaxies. The Big Bang Theory also provides a framework for understanding cosmic events such as the formation of hydrogen and helium and the cosmic microwave background radiation. Over time, it has been supported by numerous astronomical observations, making it a cornerstone of modern cosmology.",

This principle is a fundamental aspect of quantum systems and underpins phenomena such as quantum entanglement and interference. Superposition leads to the counterintuitive predictions and observations that distinguish quantum mechanics from classical physics. For example, it allows electrons to pass through two slits simultaneously in the famous double-slit experiment, creating an interference pattern on a detector screen. This behavior, which cannot be explained by classical physics, has profound implications for the development of quantum computing and encryption technologies. The principle of superposition challenges our classical intuitions about how objects should behave and has paved the way for new technologies that exploit these quantum properties.",

According to the law of demand, as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases, and vice versa. Conversely, the law of supply states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa. The interaction of supply and demand determines the equilibrium price and quantity in a market. Market equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, and at this point, the allocation of goods is at its most efficient. Shifts in supply or demand can lead to changes in market conditions, causing prices to fluctuate. For example, an increase in production costs might shift the supply curve upward, leading to higher prices and lower quantity demanded. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for economic analysis and policy-making, as it helps predict how changes in market conditions will affect prices and production.",

Each of these factors can contribute to the overall inflationary pressure within an economy. Understanding these causes is crucial for central banks and policymakers who implement measures to control inflation, such as adjusting interest rates or altering money supply. Inflation monitoring and control are vital to maintaining economic stability and preserving the purchasing power of a currency. High inflation can erode savings and reduce the effectiveness of investment, while deflation can lead to reduced consumer spending and economic slowdown. Central banks aim to maintain inflation at a target rate, balancing economic growth against the risk of rising prices.",

A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to the Sun's, while its volume is comparable to Earth's.\n\nWhite dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star or black hole. After the hydrogen-fusing period of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends, such a star will expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple-alpha process. If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon (around 1 billion K), an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After such a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula, it will leave behind a core, which is the remnant white dwarf. Usually, white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen (CO white dwarf). If the mass of the progenitor is between 7 and 9 solar masses (M☉), the core temperature will be sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon, in which case an oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg or ONe) white dwarf may form.[6] Stars of very low mass will be unable to fuse helium; hence, a helium white dwarf may form by mass loss in binary systems.",
        "answer":"A star evolves into a white dwarf after it exhausts its hydrogen fuel, expands into a red giant, and then sheds its outer layers. The final composition of a white dwarf depends on the initial mass of the star and the extent of nuclear fusion it can achieve before shedding its outer layers."

        "instruction": "What triggers a supernova explosion?",
        "document": "A supernova is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion that occurs at the end of a massive star's life cycle. There are two main types of supernovae: Type I and Type II, which are triggered by different mechanisms. Type II supernovae occur when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo core collapse, leading to a catastrophic explosion. The consequences of a supernova include the dispersal of heavy elements into space, the formation of neutron stars or black holes, and the generation of shock waves that can trigger the formation of new stars. The released material enriches the interstellar medium with heavier elements, which are essential for the formation of new planets and life. Moreover, the shock waves from the explosion can initiate star formation in nearby clouds of gas and dust. Observations of supernovae have also been crucial for understanding the scale of the universe and for measuring cosmic distances. These cosmic events are among the most energetic and are key to the astrochemical processes in galaxies.",

        "instruction": "What are the different types of nebulae?",
        "document": "A nebula is a vast cloud of gas and dust in space, often illuminated by nearby stars or other sources of radiation. There are several types of nebulae, including emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, and planetary nebulae, each formed through different processes. Emission nebulae are created by the ionization of gas clouds by nearby stars, while reflection nebulae result from the scattering of starlight by dust particles. Planetary nebulae form from the outer layers of dying stars being ejected into space, creating intricate shapes and structures. These nebulae serve as the birthplaces of stars and planetary systems, playing a critical role in the cycle of stellar evolution. Their varied colors and forms make them important subjects of study in astronomy, revealing much about the composition and dynamics of the interstellar medium. Nebulae are also key to understanding the life cycle of stars, from their birth in dense molecular clouds to their death, which may result in yet another nebula. They provide astronomers with valuable insights into the physical conditions and processes that govern the universe.",

        "instruction": "What are exoplanets?",
        "document": "Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. They are discovered using various methods, including the transit method, which observes the dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it, and the radial velocity method, which detects changes in a star's velocity due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. These discoveries have expanded our understanding of the universe and the potential for life beyond Earth. The study of exoplanets has revolutionized astrophysics, offering insights into planetary systems vastly different from our own. This field continues to grow with the advancement of technology, such as space telescopes that can detect the atmospheric composition of exoplanets, potentially identifying signs of habitability or life. The diversity of exoplanets challenges previous models of planet formation and evolution, leading to new theories and discoveries. As of now, thousands of exoplanets have been identified, demonstrating the vastness and variety of planets in our galaxy.",

        "instruction": "What is dark matter?",
        "document": "Dark matter is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects. It is thought to comprise about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. Dark matter plays a crucial role in the structure and evolution of the universe, influencing the formation and movement of galaxies. It acts as a gravitational 'glue' that helps hold galaxies together and affects their rotational speeds. Despite its invisibility, dark matter's presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. It is also essential for explaining anomalies in the rotational speeds of galaxies; without dark matter, the outer regions of galaxies would rotate much slower than observed. Researchers are exploring multiple theories and conducting experiments to detect dark matter particles directly, but so far, it remains one of the most elusive aspects of modern astrophysics. Understanding dark matter is fundamental to comprehending the full picture of the cosmos, including the ultimate fate of the universe.",
