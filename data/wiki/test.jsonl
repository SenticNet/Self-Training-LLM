The term 'local' means that this prison holds people on remand to the local courts. The prison is operated by His Majesty's Prison Service.\n\nHistory\nHull Prison opened in 1870, and is of a typical Victorian design. \nEthel Major was the last person and only woman to be executed at Hull in 1934. She had been convicted of the murder of her husband. An exhibition \"Within These Walls\" follows the prison's history from 1299 to 1934. \nThe exhibition was designed and created by Officer Rob Nicholson and officially opened by Lawrence Major, Ethel's grandson.\n\nIn 1976 Hull prison was involved in a three-day riot by inmates of the prison. Over 100 prisoners were involved in a protest that erupted over staff brutality. The riot ended peacefully on 3 September 1976 but over two thirds of the prison was destroyed,\nwith an estimated repair cost of £3 – £4 million. The prison was closed for a year while repairs were carried out. Disciplinary proceedings following the riots led to a number of legal challenges.\n\nThe Prison was removed from the high-security estate in 1985 and became a local prison holding inmates remanded and sentenced by courts in the area.\n\nIn 2002 a major expansion was completed making the prison more modern rather than Victorian, which added four new wings, a new gymnasium, a new health care centre and a multi-faith centre.\n\nIn January 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that older parts of Hull Prison will close, with a reduction of 282 places at the prison. In April 2014 the Ministry of Justice announced that these would be brought back into use as the \"prison population is currently above published projections\".\n\nAfter rioting at Birmingham Prison in December 2016, some prisoners were transferred from Birmingham to Hull.  Disturbances were reported at HMP Hull.\n\nOn 14 September 2018, Staff at HMP Hull, along with many other prisons across the country, walked out under protest due to health and safety conditions across the prison estate. The protest was amid fears of rising violence, wanting safety improvements and a reduction in violence and overcrowding.\n\nIn January 2019, it was announced that HMP Hull will be one of 10 prisons chosen for body scanners which aims to reduce drugs and violence, while improving standards, in the country's most challenging jails providing a template for the wider estate.\n\nIn January 2021, it was reported that HMP Hull had been dealing with a huge COVID-19 outbreak which saw around 80 prisoners and staff struck down by the virus.\n\nThe prison today\nHull is a local prison holding remand, sentenced and convicted males. Prisoners are employed in the workshops, kitchens, gardens and waste management departments. Education classes are also available to prisoners.\n\nHMP Hull houses the Within These Walls exhibition which charts the history of Hull's prisons from 1299 through to the present day.

{"topic": "Tori Freestone", "document": "Victoria (\"Tori\") Freestone is a British saxophonist, flautist, violinist and composer. She has performed British jazz since 2009 as a band leader and sidewoman, known for her robust tenor sound and melodic invention. Her \"Trio\" albums, released in 2014 and 2016, were awarded at least 4 stars. The Guardian critic John Fordham described her first album \"In The Chop House\" as \"an imposingly original sound\".\nIn 2017 Freestone was shortlisted for a Fellowship in Jazz Composition supported by PRS for Music Foundation, UK Arts Foundation. That year Freestone was also nominated in the Parliamentary Jazz Awards 2017 in the Jazz Instrumentalist of the Year category.\n\nCareer\nFreestone started performing in folk clubs at the age of seven. She joined the National Youth Jazz Orchestra when she was 17 and then went on to study jazz flute at Leeds College of Music, then progressed to the saxophone when she was 26. Freestone likes to compose for unusual instrumentation that challenges traditional composition and improvisational techniques, most notably in her trio she explores the avenues of composing for a group that is led without a harmony instrument. Freestone features in many UK bands such as the Andre Canniere Sextet and Ivo Neame Quintet, but her main focus is on three projects: The Tori Freestone Trio, the Tori Freestone/ Alcyona Mick Duo and the sextet 'Solstice'. She has appeared at a number of UK Jazz Festivals including Manchester Jazz Festival in 2015 with a project with trumpeter Neil Yates and her duo with pianist Alcyona Mick. More recently she appeared at The Barbican, London as part of a larger ensemble all-star band with Hermeto Pascoal. She also performs on tour with the Julian Siegel Big Band.\n\nRecordings\nFreestone's debut album with her Trio was In the Chop House, released in 2014 on Whirlwind Recordings. This album featured Freestone on tenor saxophone, Dave Manington on double bass and Tim Giles on drums. The Guardian gave the album 4 stars and said: \"In being supported by only bass and drums (Dave Manington and Tim Giles), Freestone goes for one of a saxophonist's toughest options, but she is more than up to it.\"All About Jazz placed this album in their top 10 albums of 2014 and gave it four and a half stars.\n\nHer second album, with the same trio, El Barranco, again released on Whirlwind Recordings, garnered similarly excellent 4-star reviews. John Fordham wrote \"...fascinating once again for the ways in which an exceptional improviser can spin new yarns from the most deliberately restricted of resources – just an unbugged sax, bass and drums. Freestone has an arresting Coltrane-inflected sound...\" In 2018 her duo album with pianist Alcyona Mick entitled Criss Cross received many 4 star reviews including one in All About Jazz \"This is elegant, engaging and original music, played with magnificent panache.\"\n\nIn 2019, her third Trio album El Mar de Nubes received 4 stars from John Fordham \"...this impressive trio shows formidable range, balancing free-jazz delicacy and bite\".\n\nDiscography\nAs leader\n 2019: El Mar de Nubes (Whirlwind Recordings) with Tori Freestone Trio\n 2016: El Barranco (Whirlwind Recordings) with Tori Freestone Trio\n 2014: In The Chop House (Whirlwind Recordings) with Tori Freestone Trio\nAs co-leader\n 2018: Criss Cross (Whirlwind Recordings) with Alcyona Mick\nAs sideman\n 2016:  Alimentation (Two Rivers Records) with Solstice\n 2016:  The Darkening Blue (Whirlwind Recordings) with Andre Canniere\n 2015:  Strata (Edition Records) with Ivo Neame Quintet\n 2013:  Ichthyology (Groove Laboratory Productions) with Jamil Sheriff Big Band\n 2013:  Entertaining Tyrants (Jellymould Jazz) with Compassionate Dictatorship\n 2013:  Clocca (Loop Collective) with Fringe Magnetic\n 2012:  Yatra (Edition Records) with Ivo Neame Octet\n 2011:  Things Will Be (Impossible Ark Records) with Riaan Visloo Examples of Twelves\n 2011:  Twistic (Loop Collective) with Fringe Magnestic\n 2010:  Cash Cows (FMR) with Compassionate Dictatorship\n 2009:  Empty Spaces (Loop Collective) with Fridge Magnetic\n 2008:  Club Rouge (Deep Touch Records) with Levan J\n 2007:  Coup d'Etat (FMR) with Compassionate Dictatorship\n 2005:  Sunday Morning (Deep Touch Records) with Levan J\n 2004:  Cool Day (Deep Touch Records) with Levan J\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\nBritish jazz saxophonists\nBritish jazz flautists\nLiving people\n21st-century saxophonists\nYear of birth missing (living people)\n21st-century flautists\nWhirlwind Recordings artists", "instruction": " What year did Tori Freestone begin her career in jazz?"}

He holds a master's degree from Pembroke College, Oxford and an MBA from INSEAD. He is also a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.\n\nBentley is married and has two children.\n\nCareer\nBentley joined BP's graduate recruitment scheme in 1982, training as a management accountant. He worked in China from 1983 to 1985, and then Egypt and the US, before returning to the UK as head of capital markets. He joined Grand Metropolitan in 1995, which became Diageo in 1997; from 1 July 1999 until 2000 he was finance director of UDV Guinness.\n\nCentrica\nBentley was group finance director of Centrica from 2000 to February 2007. and was also managing director, Europe from July 2004 to September 2006.\n\nOn 19 September 2006 it was announced that Bentley would become the managing director of British Gas, part of the Centrica group, taking over from Mark Clare from March 2007. Bentley's stewardship was often controversial, as the company raised residential energy prices several times during his reign; protests at company premises were not unusual. Bentley frequently appeared in the media defending the company's decisions. The controversy was fuelled by the rise in profits during Bentley's stewardship – profits from the residential energy division of British Gas increased by 24% in one year alone. Bentley repeatedly claimed that price rises were beyond the company's control, and that they were not increased to raise profits.  Bentley said that the reason for the price increase was that average domestic gas consumption had increased by 12 per cent compared to the warmer previous year. Throughout his time at the company Bentley's salary (£681,000 in 2013) was the subject of frequent criticism.\n\nAs managing director for seven-years, Bentley did have commercial success at Centrica, increasing turnover by nearly £4 billion. He was credited with improving the company’s customer services and rolling out new technologies such as smart meters.\n\nOn 27 February 2013, Centrica announced that Bentley would step down from his role at British Gas, from the Centrica board on 30 June 2013, and leave the company's employment on 31 December 2013. Bentley was replaced by the managing director of Direct Energy (also part of the Centrica group) Chris Weston.\n\nCable and Wireless\nOn 17 October 2013 it was announced that Bentley would succeed Tony Rice as CEO of Cable & Wireless Communications from 1 January 2014, coinciding with the relocation of the company headquarters from London to Miami, Florida. On 6 January 2014, C&WC announced that Bentley had purchased 4.3 million shares in the company, at a value of around 3 times his basic salary of £800,000. He demitted office after the acquisition of CWC by Liberty Global on 16 May 2016.\n\nMitie\nIn October 2016, it was announced that he would succeed Ruby McGregor-Smith as CEO of Mitie, which he duly did on 13 December 2016. Under Bentley’s leadership, Mitie has become the biggest FM operator in the UK, partly because of their acquisition of Interserve in late 2020. Since the start of the COVID pandemic, Bentley has overseen Mitie’s work delivering a wide range of services, including running Covid-19 testing sites, cleaning offices and major transport services, and providing security for new quarantine hotels.

{"topic": "Chinook wind", "document": "Chinook winds, or simply Chinooks, are two types of prevailing warm, generally westerly winds in western North America: Coastal Chinooks and interior Chinooks. The coastal Chinooks are persistent seasonal, wet, southwesterly winds blowing in from the ocean. The interior Chinooks are occasional warm, dry föhn winds blowing down the eastern sides of interior mountain ranges. The coastal Chinooks were the original term, used along the northwest coast, and the term in the interior of North America is later and derives from the coastal term.\n Along the Pacific Northwest coast, where the name is pronounced  ('chin'+'uk'), the name refers to wet, warm winds off the ocean from the southwest; this is the original use of the term. The coastal Chinook winds deliver tremendous amounts of moisture both as rain along the coast and snow in the coastal mountains, that sustain the characteristic temperate rainforests and climate of the Pacific Northwest.\n\n In North American western interior, the same name is used for föhn winds, generally, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains lie immediately east of various interior mountain ranges. There the name is pronounced  ('shin'+'uk'). The same warm, wet coastal winds can also become the warm föhn winds on the eastern sides of mountain ranges, after having lost their moisture on the western sides; however, due to expanded use of the term in the interior for any föhn wind, interior Chinooks are not necessarily originally coastal Chinooks.\n\nIn the interior of North America, the Blackfoot people call these winds the \"snow eater\"; however, the more commonly used term \"Chinook\" originates from the name of the eponymous Chinook people, who lived near the ocean, along the lower Columbia River, where the term was first derived. The reference to  \"a Chinook\" wind or weather system originally meant, to euro-American settlers along the Pacific Northwest coast, a warming wind from the ocean blowing into the interior regions of the Pacific Northwest of the North America.\n\nA strong föhn wind can make snow one foot (30 cm) deep almost vanish in one day. The snow partly sublimates and partly melts and evaporates in the dry wind. Chinook winds have been observed to raise winter temperature, often from below −20 °C (−4°F) to as high as 10–20°C (50–68°F) for a few hours or days, then temperatures plummet to their base levels.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest\n\n\"Chinook\" is used for coastal Chinook winds in British Columbia, and is the original use of the term, being rooted in the lore of coastal natives and immigrants, and brought to Alberta by French-speaking fur-traders. Such winds are extremely wet and warm and arrive off the western coast of North America from the southwest.\nThese same winds have more recently been called the pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the Pacific near Hawaii.\n\nThe air associated with a coastal Chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. In exposed areas, fresh gales are frequent during a Chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon; most of the region's stormy winds come when a fast \"westerly\" jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash.\n\nWhen a coastal Chinook comes in when an Arctic air mass is holding steady over the coast, the tropical dampness brought in suddenly cools, penetrating the frozen air and coming down in volumes of powder snow, sometimes to sea level. Snowfalls and the cold spells that spawned them only last a few days during a Chinook; as the warm coastal Chinooks blow from the southwest, they push back east the cold Arctic air. The snow melts quickly and is gone within a week.\n\nThe effects on the Interior of British Columbia when a coastal Chinook is in effect are the reverse. In a rainy spell, most of the heavy moisture will be wrung out of the rising air as a consequence of crossing over the mountain ramparts before the air mass descends (and hence warms and dries) into the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson River-Okanagan area. The effects are similar to those of an Albertan interior Chinook, though not to the same extreme, partly because the Okanagan is relatively warmer than the Prairies, and partly because of the additional number of precipitation-catching mountain ranges between Kelowna and Calgary. When the coastal Chinook brings snow to the coast during a period of coastal cold, bright but chilly weather in the interior will give way to a slushy melting of snow, more due to the warm spell than because of rain.\n\nPronunciation in the Pacific Northwest\nThe word \"Chinook\" remains in common use among local fishermen and people in communities along the British Columbia Coast, and coastal Washington and Oregon, and in particular, the term is used in the Puget Sound area of Washington. Coastal \"Chinook\" is not pronounced shin-uk ()  as it is in the interior, east of the Cascades, but is in the original coastal pronunciation chin-uk ().\n\nIn British Columbia and other parts of the Pacific Northwest, the word Chinook was predominantly pronounced  . However, the common pronunciation current throughout most of the inland Pacific Northwest, Alberta, and the rest of Canada, is  , as in French. This difference may be because it was the Métis employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, who were familiar with the Chinook people and country, brought the name east of the Cascades and Rockies, along with their own ethnic pronunciation. Early records are clear that tshinook was the original pronunciation, before the word's transmission east of the Rockies.\n\nFirst nations myth from British Columbia \n\nNative legend of the Lil'wat subgroup of the St'at'imc tells of a girl named Chinook-Wind, who married Chinook Glacier, and moved to his country, which was in the area of today's Birkenhead River. She pined for her warm sea-home in the southwest, and sent a message to her people. They came to her in a vision in the form of snowflakes, and told her they were coming to get her. They came in great number and quarrelled with Glacier over her, but they overwhelmed him and in the end she went home with them.\n\nChinooks in Alberta and eastern British Columbia\n\nInterior Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada, especially in a belt from Pincher Creek and Crowsnest Pass through Lethbridge, which get 30–35 Chinook days per year, on average. Interior Chinooks become less frequent further south in the United States, and are not as common north of Red Deer, but they can and do occur annually as far north as High Level in northwestern Alberta and Fort St. John in northeastern British Columbia, and as far south as Las Vegas, Nevada, and occasionally to Carlsbad, in eastern New Mexico.\n\nIn Pincher Creek, the temperature rose by , from , in one hour on 6 January 1966. During the winter, driving can be treacherous, as the wind blows snow across roadways, sometimes causing roads to vanish and snowdrifts to pile up higher than a metre. Empty semitrailer trucks driving along Highway 3 and other routes in southern Alberta have been blown over by the high gusts of wind caused by interior Chinooks.\n\nOn 27 February 1992, Claresholm, Alberta, a town just south of Calgary, recorded a temperature of ; again, the next day  was recorded.\n\nClashing with Arctic air mass \nThe interior Chinooks can seem to battle with Arctic air masses  at times.\n\nThis clash of temperatures can remain stationary, or move back and forth, in the latter case causing such fluctuations as a warm morning, a bitterly cold afternoon, and a warm evening. A curtain of fog often accompanies the clash between warm to the west and cold to the east.\n\nChinook arch \n\nTwo common cloud patterns seen in the interior during this time are a chinook arch overhead, and a bank of clouds (also referred to as a cloud wall) obscuring the mountains to the west. The bank appears to be an approaching storm, but does not advance any further to the east.\n\nOne of its most striking features of the interior Chinook weather system is the Chinook arch, a föhn cloud in the form of a band of stationary stratus clouds, caused by air rippling over the mountains due to orographic lifting.

He is the son of former Alaska Attorney General Avrum and Shari Gross, the first Executive Director of the United Fishermen of Alaska, who also founded the League of Women Voters-Alaska. As a child, he was part of the small Jewish community in Alaska, and had the first bar mitzvah in Southeast Alaska. While attending Douglas High School in Juneau, Gross developed an interest in fishing, both sport and commercial. When he was 14, he bought his first commercial fishing boat with a bank loan. He commercially gillnet fished for salmon in the summer to pay his way through college and medical school.\n\nGross attended Douglas High School in Juneau before enrolling at Amherst College, where he graduated in 1985 with a degree in neuroscience. He studied medicine at the University of Washington’s WWAMI Regional Medical Education Program, graduating in 1989.\n\nMedical career\nAfter graduating from medical school, Gross served as the president of the Bartlett Regional Hospital medical staff. In 2006, he founded and served as the president of the Juneau Bone and Joint Center. Gross retired from full-time orthopedic surgery in 2013, but continues to work part time for the Petersburg Medical Center, and volunteers at a training hospital in Cambodia every year.\n\nGross practiced as an orthopedic surgeon in Juneau, beginning in 1994. In 2013, Gross left his practice, along with his wife Monica Gross, to study health care economics, earning a master's of public health at University of California, Los Angeles. He has said that he grew uncomfortable with the high costs of healthcare, and pursued his MPH degree to study solutions.\n\nPolitical career\nAfter earning his MPH, Gross returned to Alaska and began his advocacy for healthcare reform. In 2017, he co-sponsored two ballot initiatives in Alaska. The Quality Health Insurance for Alaskans Act sought to add certain provisions from the Affordable Care Act into state law, including protection against discrimination based on preexisting conditions, mandatory coverage for prenatal and maternal care, and provisions that children could remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26. The Healthcare for Alaskans Act would codify the Medicaid expansion, already in effect due to an executive order by Governor Bill Walker. Both initiatives were withdrawn from the ballot in December 2017. Supporters cited uncertainty in healthcare policy at the federal level as the reason for the withdrawal.\n\n2020 U.S. Senate campaign\n\nOn July 2, 2019, Gross announced he would run as an independent in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Alaska. He won the August Democratic primary against Democrat Edgar Blatchford and Independent Chris Cumings, gaining the nomination of the Alaska Democratic Party, which had endorsed him before the filing deadline.\n\nGross ran as an independent against Republican incumbent Senator Dan Sullivan. He had the support of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and The Lincoln Project.\n\nGross said, \"I stepped up to do this because the Alaska economy has been failing, we’ve been losing Alaskans to the Lower 48 for the past few years, and despite that labor loss, we had the highest unemployment in the country.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast argued that Alaska \"flirts with purple-state status\" in part due to Gross's candidacy. There was speculation that the political fallout of the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination could dampen support for incumbent Sullivan and benefit Gross's campaign.\n\nMore than a week after the election, Sullivan's reelection in what was expected to be a close race was affirmed.\n\nIn October 2021, Gross ran for Hospital Board in Petersburg, Alaska and finished fourth.\n\n2022 U.S. House campaign\n\nOn March 28, 2022, Gross announced he would run as an independent candidate for Alaska's at-large congressional seat that was vacated upon the death of Congressman Don Young. Although he won third place and the opportunity to compete in the general election, he withdrew on June 20, 2022.\n\nPolitical positions\nDespite receiving the Alaska Democratic Party's endorsement, Gross is an independent politician and says he is closer to Republicans on \"issues like guns and immigration\".\n\nGross supports an overhaul of Medicare, including the addition of a public option. He also supports raising the minimum wage, defending collective bargaining rights for workers and unions, efforts to make college more affordable and accessible, and earlier tracking into trade schools. Citing his background in science, Gross supports policies that address climate change, including the growth of renewable energy and opposition to the Pebble Mine project. He also supports ending Citizens United and fixing political corruption.\n\nGross fully supports instant-runoff voting. He is neutral on Universal Basic Income (UBI), which resembles the Alaska Permanent Fund (APF), saying, \"The UBI check here in Alaska has been a great program, but any program like that, you have to be careful you don't disincentivize going back to the workforce.\"\n\nEnvironmental and energy policy\nGross opposes the proposed Pebble Mine, which threatens to harm the ecosystem of Bristol Bay. His campaign could have benefited from reports of Sullivan's inconsistency on this issue, and secretly recorded tapes in which corporate executives indicate that Sullivan could switch his position on the mine after the election.\n\nGross accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and its impacts on Alaska. He supports diversification of Alaska's economy and its energy supply, including renewable energy. Like Sullivan, he supports oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nGross opposes the Green New Deal.\n\nForeign policy\nGross has said that Russian and Chinese interest in the Arctic must be counterbalanced by a strong U.S. military. He has said that he would be a \"staunch defender\" of Israel.\n\nGun policy\nGross has said that he is a \"strong proponent of the Second Amendment\" and \"will vote against banning any guns.\" He has stated support for background checks on military assault weapons.\n\nHealth care\nAs a physician, Gross has supported initiatives to lower health care costs. His campaign endorsed a public health care option for individuals and small businesses.\n\nIn 2017, he wrote in support of single-payer, but he did not include single-payer as part of his senatorial campaign and his radio, social media and television ads initially opposed the idea. In 2020, he said he supports federal legalization of cannabis to help small businesses and others.\n\nSocial policy\nGross was endorsed by Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nElectoral history\n\n2020\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Campaign website\n\n \n\n1962 births\n20th-century American physicians\n21st-century American Jews\n21st-century American physicians\n21st-century American politicians\nAlaska Independents\nAmherst College alumni\nCandidates in the 2020 United States Senate elections\nJewish American people in Alaska politics\nJewish physicians\nLiving people\nPoliticians from Juneau, Alaska\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles alumni\nUniversity of Washington alumni\nCandidates in the 2022 United States House of Representatives elections", "instruction": " What specific policies has Alan Gross proposed for addressing income inequality in Alaska?"}
{"topic": "Walter Hearne", "document": "Walter Hearne (15 January 1864 - 2 April 1925) was an English professional cricketer for Kent County Cricket Club towards the end of the 19th century. He played primarily as a bowler but suffered from injuries and his career was cut short as a result. He was the elder brother of the great Middlesex bowler J. T. Hearne who played for England in Test cricket whilst his older brother, Herbert Hearne, also played for Kent. He was a member of the extended Hearne family.\n\nEarly life and family\nHearne was born at Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire in 1864, the son of William Hearne who was considered a good local cricketer. Part of the extended Hearne family, Hearne and his brothers played cricket – he and Herbert for Kent and Jack and oldest brother William for Middlesex, although William only played for the Second XI. Three cousins played Test cricket as did Jack.\n\nCricket career\nHearne was a medium-paced right-arm bowler who, similar to his brother Jack bowled with great accuracy and a pronounced off-break. He made his first-class cricket debut for Kent in 1887, playing six matches in what was described as a \"trial\" period and did not appear for the county against until 1890 before becoming a regular member of the Kent team only in 1892.\n\nMost of Walter Hearne’s first-class cricket was played between 1892 and 1894, although a knee injury limited his appearances during 1893 to just six matches. He took 15 wickets against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1893 and in 1894 completed a hat-trick against the same side. During the 1894 season he took 116 first-class wickets, 99 of them in county matches, including a series of three matches in July when he took 13/61 against Gloucestershire, 12/72 against Nottinghamshire and 13/98 against Surrey – a total of 38 wickets for 231 runs. His 116 wickets were taken at an average of 13.29 and followed returns of 93 and 46 wickets in the previous two seasons.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1895 season Walter Hearne’s knee failed and he was unable to play a first-class match during the season – although he was able to play in few non-first-class matches for MCC. He seemed fit at the start of the 1896 season but in his third match against Yorkshire at Leeds his knee \"gave way so badly\" that he was forced to retire from cricket, surgery proving ineffective.\n\nLater life\nHearne took on the role of official scorer for Kent after his retirement, retaining the post for the rest of his life. He scored in each Kent's four County Championship winning sides between 1906 and 1913 and resumed the role after the First World War. He died at Canterbury in Kent in 1925 aged 61, his cousin Alec Hearne taking over the role of scorer.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1864 births\n1925 deaths\nEnglish cricketers\nKent cricketers\nCricketers from Buckinghamshire", "instruction": " What specific injury caused Walter Hearne to retire from cricket after the 1896 season?"}

{"topic": "Martin Crimp", "document": "Martin Andrew Crimp (born 14 February 1956 in Dartford, Kent) is a British playwright.\n\nEarly life and career\nThe son of John Crimp, a British Rail signalling engineer, and his wife Jennie, Crimp's family moved in 1960 to Streatham where he attended a local primary school before winning a scholarship to Dulwich College. But when his father was transferred to York, he went to the nearby Pocklington School, where he showed an aptitude for languages, music, English literature, and theatre. He read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge (1975–78), where his first play Clang was staged by fellow student Roger Michell. Before establishing himself as a playwright, he put together An Anatomy, a collection of short stories, and also wrote a novel Still Early Days. These remain unpublished.\n\nHis first six plays were performed at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond. As he told Marsha Hanlon in an interview for the Orange Tree appeal brochure in 1991: \"When the Orange Tree ran a workshop for local writers [in September 1981], I was invited to take part. The carrot was the chance of a lunchtime production, so I wrote Living Remains and the Orange Tree staged it – my first-ever produced play! I was so excited that I didn't think about the space where it was performed [then a room above a pub], but now I realise that the Orange Tree's intimacy and simplicity provided an extra layer of excitement.\"\n\nSeven of his plays, and his second Ionesco translation have also been presented at the Royal Court Theatre, London, where he became writer-in-residence in 1997.\n\nProfessional career\n\nPlaywright \nCrimp’s play Attempts on Her Life, which premiered at London’s Royal Court Theatre in 1997, was described by critic Aleks Sierz as the \"event that secured his reputation as the most innovative, most exciting, and most exportable playwright of his generation\" [Sierz, Aleks, Aleks, (2013) p.48]. The play presents a unique structure, as none of the lines are assigned to specific characters, and Crimp does not specify the number of actors required to perform the piece. The play consists of seventeen seemingly unrelated scenes in which groups of people provide contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist, a woman who is discussed as a terrorist, the daughter of grieving parents, an artist, and even a new car. Through its deliberate fragmentation, Attempts on Her Life challenges the audience to reconsider their understanding of what constitutes a \"play\" and raises questions about the existence of individuals beyond the constructs we create.\n\nHis other plays range from tragi-comic studies of suburban guilt and repression — Definitely the Bahamas (1987), Dealing with Clair (1989), The Country (2000) — via the satirical ‘entertainment’ In the Republic of Happiness (2012) — to powerful re-writings of Greek classics — Cruel & Tender (2004), The Rest Will Be Familiar to You from Cinema (2013). This unusual variety has led Vicky Angelaki to write:\n\nCrimp's work has successfully received numerous productions abroad. In Germany, he is considered to be \"one of the most respected British playwrights\" and it was reported in 2013 that there has been \"more than 60 German-language productions of his work in the past two decades.\"\n\nIn 2021, Crimp was recipient of Germany’s Nyssen-Bansemer theater prize in recognition of the importance of his body of work. [Süddeutsche Zeitung, 29 March 2021] Writing about the prize in Theater heute magazine, Till Briegleb praises the way that “With great authority, Crimp sketches the most diverse victims of a bourgeois society that wants to ignore all connections between their tranquil existence and the violence that makes it possible. From the murderer to the child, everyone who appears is unique, their life-lies and fears individual.”\n\nMartin Crimp is sometimes described as a practitioner of the \"in-yer-face\" school of contemporary British drama, although he rejects the label. \n\nIn 2022, he performed his play Not one of these people, which gave voice to 299 different characters. Supported with a live deepfake video generator, imagined by Quebec director Christian Lapointe, the playwright accepted Lapointe’s invitation to perform as an actor on stage for the first time.\n\nTheatre translator \nFrom 1997 onwards, Crimp has had a parallel career as theatre translator, making his first impact at the Royal Court Theatre with a translation of Ionesco’s The Chairs, a production that subsequently transferred to Broadway. His re-writings of Molière’s The Misanthrope (1996, revived 2009) and Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac (2019/22) were both commercially and critically successful, the latter transferring from London’s West End to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. These rewritings have led some critics to see them as new plays. Angelaki, for example, argues that \"Crimp’s radical adaptations … depart substantially from the early versions of the texts that inspire them and as such belong to a discussion of Crimp’s playwriting canon, rather than of his translations or versions\" [Angelaki, Vicky, Op. Cit. page 154]\n\nOpera librettist \n\nIn 2006, Crimp began a collaboration with composer George Benjamin that has led to the creation of three operas: Into the Little Hill (2006), Written on Skin (2012) and Lessons in Love and Violence (2018). Written on Skin in particular has garnered international acclaim since its premiere at the Festival d’Aix en Provence in 2012.\n\nWorks\n\nPlays \nNot One Of These People (Carrefour international de théâtre Théâtre La Bordée 2022 )\nWhen We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other: 12 Variations on Samuel Richardson’s Pamela, (\"provoked\" by Richardson's Pamela, National Theatre, Dorfman, 2019)\nMen Asleep (Deutsches Shauspielhaus 2018)\nThe Rest Will Be Familiar to You from Cinema (inspired by Euripides' Phoenician Women, Deutsches Shauspielhaus 2013)\nIn the Republic of Happiness (Royal Court Theatre 2012)\nPlay House (Orange Tree 2012, revived with Definitely the Bahamas and directed by the author)\nThe City (Royal Court, Jerwood Theatre Downstairs 2008)\nFewer Emergencies (Royal Court, Theatre Upstairs 2005)\nCruel and Tender (Young Vic 2004)\nAdvice to Iraqi women (Royal Court 2003)\nFace to the Wall (Royal Court 2002)\nThe Country (Royal Court 2000, revived at the Tabard Theatre May 2008)\nAttempts on Her Life (Royal Court 1997; National Theatre, Lyttelton, March 2007)\nThe Treatment (Royal Court 1993; revived Almeida Theatre 2017)\nGetting Attention (Royal Court, Theatre Upstairs 1991)\nNo One Sees the Video (Royal Court, Theatre Upstairs 1990)\nPlay with Repeats (Orange Tree 1989)\nDealing with Clair (Orange Tree 1988)\nDefinitely the Bahamas, \"a group of three plays for consecutive performance\" also including A Kind of Arden and The Spanish Girls (Orange Tree 1987)\nA Variety of Death-Defying Acts (Orange Tree 1985)\nFour Attempted Acts (Orange Tree 1984)\nLiving Remains (Orange Tree lunchtime, 9–25 July 1982)\n\nTranslations \nCyrano De Bergerac (Rostand) (Playhouse Theatre 2019, Harold Pinter Theatre 2022)\nBig and Small (Gross und klein by Botho Strauß), a 2011 Sydney Theatre Company production, co-comm", "instruction": " What motivated Martin Crimp to start writing plays after initially focusing on short stories and a novel?"}

Kennedy first chases Laurel and Hardy off his property with a toy bulldog. Then he barricades himself in his home, thwarting all efforts by the repo men to enter and recover the radio. When a wayward rifle shot by Kennedy knocks the top off a nearby fire hydrant and soaks a policeman, the cop investigates. Laurel and Hardy, with the officer's assistance, are finally permitted to enter Kennedy's house and take the radio.

{"topic": "Yankev Shternberg", "document": "Yankev Shternberg (in English language texts occasionally referred to as Jacob Sternberg; ; ; 1890, Lipcani, Bessarabia, Russian Empire – 1973, Moscow, USSR) was a Yiddish theater director, teacher of theater, playwright, avant-garde poet and short-story writer, best known for his theater work in Romania between the two world wars.\n\nBiography\nShternberg grew up in the northern Bessarabian shtetl of Lipkany (Yiddish: Lipkon, now Lipcani in Moldova), which was famously termed \"Bessarabian Olympus\" by Hebrew and Yiddish poet Chaim Nachman Bialik and which in the second half of the 19th century produced several major figures of the modern Yiddish and Hebrew belle-lettres, among them Yehuda Shteinberg and Eliezer Steinbarg. He attended a Russian secondary school in Kamenets-Podolsky, where he was a classmate and close friend of the future Yiddish writer Moyshe Altman.\n\nShternberg debuted in 1908 with a fairy tale in the newspaper Unzer Lebn (Odessa). He published poetry in Reizen's collections \"Fraye Erd\" (1910) and \"Dos Naye Land\" (1911). In the 1910s, he published poetry in the periodicals Hamer (Brăila), Frayhayt, Arbeter Tsaytung, and Dos Naye Lebm (all in Czernowitz), as well as Gut Morgn (Odessa),  (Warsaw), and Tsayt (New York). \n\nIn 1914 Shternberg settled in Romania, at first in Czernowitz (Chernivtsi, Ukraine), and later in Bucharest. He became associated with the short-lived Yiddish-language magazine Likht (\"Light\"), four issues of which were published in Iaşi between December 1914 and September 1915. Likht called for a \"renaissance of the Jewish stages in Romania\" and condemned the \"poor foundation\" of Yiddish theater as a commercial institution: \"The Yiddish stage ought to be a place of education, of drawing Jews closer together through the Yiddish word… we will fight against this [commercial] state of things.\" Israil Bercovici counts the \"literary-musical\" gatherings sponsored by that magazine as \"the beginning of modern Yiddish theater in Romania\", and sees Shternberg as preparing the way for the Vilna Troupe, the Yiddish theater troupe that brought the ideas of Konstantin Stanislavski to Romania. Nonetheless, Shternberg adopted as a slogan \"Back to Goldfaden\". Calling Abraham Goldfaden \"the Prince Charming who woke up the lethargic Romanian Jewish Culture\" when he founded professional Yiddish theater in 1876 (Iaşi), Shternberg wrote, \"The only milieu that attracts the great Jewish masses is a traditional-cultural theater. Not even a literary theater… From that I created a social-political theater, a theater… [of current events]… which I think was, then, the first of its kind in Yiddish\".\n\nIn 1917–18, Shternberg and Jacob Botoshansky together founded a Yiddish revue theater in Bucharest, for which they wrote and produced nine short plays (revues), including Tsimes (named after the traditional pureed vegetable dish tsimes), Bukaresht-Yerusholaim (\"Bucharest-Jerusalem\"),  (\"All of a sudden\"), Grine bleter (\"Green leaves\"), Kukuriku, Sholem-Aleykhem (\"Hello\"), and Hershele Ostropoler (\"Hershele of Ostropol\"). In 1917, in response to antisemitic violence at that time in Romania and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, he staged passages from Bialik. In 1920, he became the editor of \"Der Veker\", official organ of the Jewish section of the Romanian Socialist Party. In 1924–26, he was the director for the \"Vilner trupe\". The Romanian daily newspaper Adevărul wrote on August 23, 1924, shortly after the troupe's arrival in Bucharest, that \"Such a demonstration of artistry, even on a small stage such as Jigniţa and even in a language like Yiddish ought to be seen by all who are interested in superior realization of drama.\"\n\nIn 1930 he created a hugely successful studio theater BITS (\"Bukareshter Yidishe Teater-Studiye\"), housed in Bucharest's Jewish quarter Văcărești, that played a prominent role in the development of modern trends in European theater. BITS staged works of Osip Dymov (Yashke-muzikant – \"Yashka the Musician\"), Jacob Gordin, I.L. Peretz (Banakht afn altn mark – \"A night at the old market\"), Sholem Aleichem (Oytser – \"Treasure\", and most famously Der farkishefter shnayder – \"The enchanted tailor\"),  (Der Geler Shotn, 1935), Nikolai Gogol (Zhenit'ba – \"The Marriage\"), – mostly musical comedies with elements of grotesque, but also I.Y. Singer's Yoshe Kalb and his own play Teater in Flamen (\"Theater in Flames\") on the theme of the then-ongoing Spanish Civil War. Sidi Tal starred in many of these productions. The performances were popular with the Bucharest intelligentsia and Peretz's \"Banakht Afn Altn Mark\", for one, was played more than 150 times. During this time, Shternberg published his first collection of poetry, in Bucharest (1938). As antisemitic, pro-fascist tendencies gained power in Bucharest, the theater left for a prolonged tour of major European cities and eventually Shternberg moved to Czernowitz, where he continued his theatrical activities.\n\nIn 1939, Shternberg along with Moyshe Altman sneaked across the Dniester and became a Soviet citizen. A year later, when his native Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union, he and most of his former troupe settled in Kishinev, where Shternberg became artistic director of the Yiddish-language Moldovan State Jewish Theater and staged, among other works, M. Daniel's Zyamke Kopatsh and Sholom-Aleichem's Motl Peysi Dem Khazns (\"Motl Peysi, the cantor's son\") with Sidi Tal in the boys' roles. During the war, he and his theatre evacuated to Uzbekistan, where he worked for the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee and was mobilized into a paramilitary construction unit. After the war, he returned to Kishinev and resumed his work at the Moldovan State Jewish Theater, where he staged his play Di Balade fun der Esesovke Brunhilde un ir hunt (\"The ballad of the SS soldier Brunhilde and her dog\") and published poetry in the almanac Heymland (1948). He was arrested at the height of the Stalin's campaign against \"rootless cosmopolitans\" (Jews) in the spring of 1949 and was sent to labour camps for 7 years. On his early return and rehabilitation 5 years later, Shternberg settled in Moscow and worked as a translator of Romanian literary works into Russian. He began to publish literary essays and poetry in the newly founded Sovetish Heymland in 1961 and briefly became a member of its editorial board. Collections of his poetry were published in Bucharest and Paris, and in Hebrew translation by Shlionsky and Penn in Israel on the occasion of his 75th birthday. Shternberg died of a heart attack in 1973 on the very day he received a permission to leave for Israel. His wife, the composer Otiliya Likhtenshteyn, who set his poems and those of other Soviet Yiddish poets (first of all Leib Kvitko) to music, died the same year. A collection of Shternberg's literary essays on theatrical topics was published posthumously in Israel.\n\nA committed socialist, Shternberg wrote that, in the wake of the October Revolution, \"we satirized bourgeois ass", "instruction": " What were the specific reasons that led Yankev Shternberg to adopt the slogan \"Back to Goldfaden\" in his call for a renaissance of the Yiddish stages in Romania?"}

He graduated from Brown University in 1996 with a B.A. and received an MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1999.\n\n\"Bootleg\" paintings\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | align = left| width = 33% | quote =[Doeringer] has come under some opposition for his stance on [copying pictures] and has received more than one cease-and-desist order from galleries and artists, but has also received praise for his activities with purchases from a few of the artists he appropriated. Viewers seem to be split, calling him either a pirate or a virtuoso.| source = Reading Eagle, April 13, 2008}}\nEric Doeringer's \"Bootlegs\" are small copies of work by eminent contemporary artists including Richard Prince and Lisa Yuskavage. Doeringer reproduces the artworks using \"collage, digital photography, paint and varnish\". Doeringer can make between six and fifteen paintings each day and told The New York Times in a 2005 interview that his process is \"like an assembly line\". On Saturdays beginning in 2001, he set up a vending table in Chelsea, Manhattan on West 24th Street. Small canvases reproducing contemporary paintings lined the table. Paintings by the original artists (sold within a short walking distance from Doeringer's stand) cost tens of thousands of dollars, while Doeringer's copies sold for less than $100. His total profit in a day of selling paintings has sometimes reached $1500. Time Out stated that Doeringer is \"famous for bootlegging art on the streets of New York\".\n\nAccording to Doeringer, the majority of the artists he copies do not mind, while others have sent him cease-and-desist letters. Richard Prince was a \"fan\" of his work, while Takashi Murakami put a stop to his copies. Doeringer states that his work is fair use because he \"culled the pictures from the public domain of the Internet\". In 2005, Chelsea art dealer Mike Weiss called the police to remove Doeringer's Bootleg stand from 24th Street. Weiss told The New York Times that \"he did so for reasons that might be condemned in the art world but that made perfect sense for any businessman like himself who has to pay a huge rent\" and claimed Doeringer was \"an opportunist and that he just wants his 15 minutes\".\n\nIn 2007, Doeringer sold his wares in the Geisai Art Fair in Miami. For the fair, he crafted 42-cent stamps decorated with pictures of celebrities. The stamps, which cost $1, were legally usable as postage and were decorated with photographs of eminent people in the art world. Over his booth, Doeringer placed orange and neon signs that proclaimed \"Best Art Deals in Miami\" and \"Nothing Over $250!\" The New York Sun deemed his decorations \"a pitch-perfect metamockery of the art fair's commercialism\".\n\nConceptual art recreations\nIn 2008, Doeringer began making larger, more faithful recreations of works of Conceptual art by artists like Sol LeWitt, Lawrence Weiner, Edward Ruscha, and On Kawara. New York magazine called a 2009 exhibition of Doeringer's Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings \"perfectly executed\" and \"a genuine aesthetic experience, not just a knowing scold.\"\n\nIn 2011, Doeringer exhibited his work at Another Year in L.A.; he titled his exhibition \"Eastern Standard Time\". In one piece, Doeringer copied Charles Ray's 1973 avant-garde photograph panorama All My Clothes. Titled All My Clothes (After Charles Ray), Doeringer's photographs each contain himself standing in front of a white background attired in various clothes. In an interview with the LA Weekly, he said he adapted Ray's general ideas for the artwork, adding that the key distinction between their works is the \"East Coast-West Coast divide\". Whereas Ray's figure is garbed in a single winter outfit, Doeringer's wears much toastier clothing. Other pieces Doeringer copied and showcased at the Los Angeles exhibition were John Baldessari's Throwing Three Balls in the Air to Get a Straight Line, On Kawara's I Went, Richard Prince's Cowboy photographs, and several of Edward Ruscha's books.\n\nIn 2012, The New York Times art critic Ken Johnson reviewed Doeringer's solo exhibition at the Mulherin + Pollard gallery titled \"The Rematerialization of the Art Object\". In the front room, Doeringer displayed \"well-made simulations\" of Damien Hirst's spot paintings and Richard Prince's Marlboro cowboy advertisements. In the back room, Doeringer presented imitations of three artists: Edward Ruscha (counterfeit books), Charles Ray (16 photographs of himself wearing various clothes in imitation of Ray's All My Clothes), and Andy Warhol (a film mimicking Warhol's Empire by recording the Empire State Building). Johnson wrote that Doeringer's \"distinction is his focus not on canonical works of Modernism but on famous Conceptualist pieces that are themselves art about art\". In 2013, the Toronto Stars Murray Whyte reviewed Doeringer's Survey'', \"a series of his exacting knock-offs of the late 20th century's greatest art hits\". In addition to containing imitations of works by Damien Hirst, Richard Prince, and Andy Warhol, the exhibition also contained imitations of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings and Lawrence Weiner's spray paintings. Art critic Murray Whyte wrote that Doeringer is \"less heretic than prophet, putting the towering genius of a previous generation to its own test\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n\n1974 births\nLiving people\nArtists from New York (state)\nAmerican conceptual artists\nBrown University alumni\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston", "instruction": " What motivates Eric Doeringer to create bootlegs and conceptual art recreations despite facing controversy and opposition?"}
{"topic": "London Central", "document": "London Central Bus Company Limited, trading as Go-Ahead London, is a bus company operating in South London. The London Central brand is a subsidiary of Go-Ahead London and operates services under contract to Transport for London.\n\nHistory\n\nLondon Central commenced operating on 1 April 1989 when London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units. In September 1994, it was sold to the Go-Ahead Group for £23.8 million. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the Go-Ahead London trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.\n\nGarages\nLondon Central operates five bus garages.\n\nBexleyheath (BX)\nAs at January 2023, Bexleyheath garage operated routes 51, 89, 132, 244, 321 (night service only on this 24-hour route), 486, 624, 625, 658, B11, B12, B13 and B16.\n\nHistory\nBuilt as a trolleybus depot by the London Passenger Transport Board, Bexleyheath was the only new garage built for trolleybuses. The depot is a large and imposing building, slightly set back from the main road to enable parking on the forecourt, which was used as a terminus for route 122. Bexleyheath closed in 1986, with work transferred to Catford, Plumstead and Sidcup garages.\n\nIn 1988 it re-opened under the guise of Bexleybus, a low-cost unit set up by London Buses under de-regulation, and had a large and varied allocation from Iveco/Robin Hoods and MCW Metroriders to Leyland Olympians and Daimler Fleetlines. The move to set up the new company to tender for routes backfired, and in the next round of tendering only route B16 was awarded to Bexleybus, whilst London Central won nine.\n\nLondon Central took control of Bexleyheath garage and routes in 1990. Lately the garage has had a good utilisation figure, up to 139 in 2001 which necessitated parking in the rear yard and the forecourt. In January 2007, the garage received its first Alexander Dennis Enviro400s for use on route 486.\n\nThis garage also houses one of the companies iBus hubs, controlling routes for Bexleyheath, Morden Wharf, New Cross, and Peckham garages.\n\nIn 2022, Bexleyheath became the first bus garage in London to be equipped for 'opportunity charge' electric bus operation, whereby the bus is charged while terminating before starting its next journey. This was introduced on route 132 whose eastern terminus is at the garage. A gantry was installed at the garage connecting with a pantograph on the top of the bus. On 9 July 2022, a fleet of Alexander Dennis Enviro400EVs began to enter service on the route.\n\nCamberwell (Q)\nAs at September 2023, Camberwell garage operated routes 1, 12, 35, 40, 42, 100, 108D, 176, 185, 355, 360, 484, N1, N15 (additional workings only) and SL6. On 30 April 2016, route 345 passed to Abellio London. On 2 May 2020, route P5 passed to Abellio London with new Caetano e.City Gold Buses.\n\nHistory\nAlthough built in 1914, Camberwell garage was not used as a bus garage until 1919 as it had been requisitioned for the war effort. Once it came into use it was one of London's largest garages and also carried out body overhauls in 1940/41. The garage was bombed during World War II in 1940 with four buses being destroyed and 13 seriously damaged.\n\nDuring the early 1950s the garage underwent modernisation with the welfare and operational block reconstructed and the parking area extended. The new building also incorporated a new pit and workshop layout in a separate self-contained block which also undertook heavy maintenance for the adjacent Walworth garage, 350 buses in all.\n\nThe allocation at Camberwell decreased slightly over the years from 165 in 1952 until the closure of Walworth garage in 1985 increased the allocation to 142. Camberwell was also the home of three Leyland Titans fitted with electronic blinds which were used on night bus standby duties.\n\nNew Routemasters were introduced on routes 12 and 68 between 2015 and 2016, and new Alexander Dennis Enviro200EVs were introduced on route 484 on 20 March 2021.\n\nOn 18 March 2023, London Central commenced operating two additional journeys on route N15.\n\nRoute 188 was transferred from this garage back to Morden Wharf (MG) garage on 30 September 2023.\n\nRoute 1 was transferred to this garage from Morden Wharf (MG) garage on 30 September 2023.\n\nMorden Wharf (MG)\nAs of September 2023, Morden Wharf garage operated routes 108, 178, 188, 225, 286, 291, 386 and 469.\n\nHistory\nOn 29 July 2017, Morden Wharf garage opened in North Greenwich after London General's Mandela Way garage closed, initially operating routes 108, 129, and 286.\n\nNew Cross (NX)\nAs at September 2023, New Cross garage operated routes 21, 36, 129, 171, 172, 321 (daytime only), 343, 436, 453, N21, N89, N136, N171 and N343.\n\nHistory\nSaid to be the largest of London's bus garages with space for over 300 buses, New Cross garage was originally a tram depot and opened in 1906. In 1952 with the trams withdrawn, the depot was converted into a bus garage. The garage has never been even close to its capacity due to the close proximity of other garages, but has at various times been used to store surplus vehicles.\n\nThe garage allocation has fluctuated over the years, from 191 in 1966 to 132 in 2001. The garage also houses some of the private hire fleet which is painted in the style of the former London General company. New Cross was also the garage for two special services, first in 1972 when it operated en ex Tilling ST on route 100 and LPG East Lancs Myllennium bodied DAF SB220s for Millennium Dome services M1 and M2. In 2003 the garage also began operating Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses on route 436. In January 2005 route 36 ceased to be operated by AEC Routemasters with one man operated double deckers taking over.\n\nPeckham (PM)\nAs at September 2023, Peckham garage operated routes 37, 197, 363 and P12.\n\nHistory\nPeckham garage was converted from a local authority maintenance depot and opened in 1994 with a capacity for 75 buses. In 2000 the garage put London's first Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TL low-floor vehicles into service on 63. Peckham won bus garage of the year in 2004, although this turned out to be a poisoned chalice for the garage, losing almost half of its work in the next year's tender awards.\n\nFleet\nAs at December 2019, London Central had a peak vehicle requirement of 676 buses.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal", "instruction": " What types of buses does London Central currently operate at Bexleyheath garage for opportunity charge electric operation on route 132?"}

{"topic": "Airgíalla", "document": "Airgíalla (Modern Irish: Oirialla, English: Oriel, Latin: Ergallia) was a medieval Irish over-kingdom and the collective name for the confederation of tribes that formed it. The confederation consisted of nine minor kingdoms, all independent of each other but paying nominal suzerainty to an overking, usually from the most powerful dynasty. Airgíalla at its peak roughly matched the modern dioceses of Armagh and Clogher, spanning parts of counties Armagh, Monaghan, Louth, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Londonderry. Its main towns were Armagh and Clogher. The name's usage survives as a cultural area of folk tradition in South East Ulster and adjoining areas of County Louth.\n\nAccording to legend, Airgíalla was founded by the Three Collas, who are said to have conquered what is now central Ulster from the Ulaid. The decisive victory was the battle of Achadh Leithdheirg, said to have been fought around the year 331. However, this tale is thought to be mostly fiction, and the actual year and circumstances of how the Airgíalla confederation came about is unknown.\n\nOriginally thought to have been under the dominance of the neighbouring Ulaid to the east, the territory of the Airgíalla from the 6th century onwards was gradually eroded by the encroachment of their northern neighbours, the Cenél nEógain of the Northern Uí Néill, as well as the Southern Uí Néill to their south. From 735 they fell under the dominance of the Cenél nEógain, and by 827 had become their vassals. The kingdom of Airgíalla was at its peak in the 12th century, under king Donnchad Ua Cerbaill. The later constricted kingdom of Airgíalla survived in Monaghan—which was known as Oirghialla and Oriel after the Norman Invasion of Ireland—under the Mac Mathghamhna, until the end of the Gaelic order in Ireland.\n\nEtymology\nAirgíalla may mean \"those who give hostages\" or \"the hostage givers\", and refers to both the Irish over-kingdom of Airgíalla, and the confederation of tribes that formed it. It is commonly Anglicised as Oriel; however, archaic Angliciations include: Uriel, Orial, Orgialla, Orgiall, Oryallia, and Ergallia.\n\nAfter the Anglo-Norman invasion, the Anglicisation \"Uriel\" became the name of the part of Airgíalla that had extended into modern-day County Louth. Similarly, the portion of Airgíalla that survived in modern-day County Monaghan, became known as Oirghialla, from which derives the Anglicisation \"Oriel\".\n\nIn early manuscripts the Bishop of Clogher was styled Bishop of Oirialla.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nAccording to legend\nIn the beginning of the 4th century, three warlike brothers, known as the Three Collas, made a conquest of a great part of Ulster, which they wrested from the Ulaid. It was the after the battle of Achadh Leithdheirg, fought around 331, that they founded Airgíalla. In this battle the forces of the Three Collas defeated the forces of Fergus Foga, king of Ulster, who was slain, and the victors burned to the ground Emain Macha, the ancient capital of Ulaid.\n \nHowever, in general it can be shown that the origin legend was written (or composed) in the second quarter of the 8th century to seal their alliance with the Northern Uí Néill.\n\nHistorical emergence\nThe earliest reference to the Airgíalla occurs in the Annals of Tigernach under the year 677, where the death of Dunchad mac Ultan, \"Rí Oigriall\", is noted. However, it is suspected of being a retrospective interpolation. On the other hand, the entry in the Annals of Ulster under the year 697 which lists Mael Fothataig mac Mael Dub as \"Rex na nAirgialla\" may indeed be genuine. Both Mael Fothatag and his son, Eochu Lemnae (died 704), are listed among the guarantors of the \"Cáin Adomnáin\" in 697. Thus it is believed that the Airgíalla were probably in existence as an entity by then, or certainly by the opening years of the 8th century.\n\n8th–12th centuries\n\n13th–16th centuries\n\nDownfall of the Realm\n\nThe Kingdom of Airgíalla came to an end in 1585 when Rossa Boy MacMahon agreed to surrender and regrant his territories to the English Crown in Ireland, with his territory becoming County Monaghan in the Tudor Kingdom of Ireland.  Rossa Buidhe had ascended to the Airgíalla kingship in 1579 and found himself geopolitically in an undesirable position; wedged between an expanding Tudor kingdom and Tír Eoghain under the O'Neill.  Initially, Rossa Boy made moves which suggested an alliance with Tír Eoghain, as he married the daughter of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. However, evidently hoping to be left alone to run affairs locally, while pledging allegiance to a distant monarch in Elizabeth I, the MacMahon met with John Perrot, then Lord Deputy of Ireland (according to some, a natural son of Tudor monarch Henry VIII) and agreed to join their Kingdom of Ireland. Airgíalla, now known as Monaghan, was divided into five baronies under native Gaelic chiefs, mostly from the MacMahon themselves.\n\nThis was not the end of the matter, however. Fearing the encroachment of the English, moving in closer and closer to his own territories, Hugh O'Neill turned to Brian Mac Hugh Og MacMahon of Dartree and married off another daughter to him. Brian Mac Hugh Og was then the tanist to the chieftainship of his people according to the native Brehon laws and O'Neill was hoping to bring the \"phantom\" Airgíalla realm back into his camp on the death of Rossa Buidhe through this pact. For his part, Ross Buidhe was trying to engineer a pro-English succession through his brother Hugh Roe MacMahon.  When the new Lord Deputy, William FitzWilliam began to pressure the acceptance of an English High Sheriff of Monaghan, O'Neill used his influence to exact opposition to it from clansmen in Monaghan (the same policy was promoted in Leitrim, Fermanagh and Donegal to encircle Tyrone). As a consequence, a military force led by Henry Bagenal was sent into the county in early 1589 to impose the sheriff and by the summer of that year, Rossa Boy was dead.\n\nDynastic groups\nAirgíalla was composed of nine minor-kingdoms, each named after their ruling dynasty. These were: \nUí Tuirtri, also spelt as Uí Tuirtre, meaning \"descendants of Tort\". They were based east of the Sperrin Mountains in eastern County Londonderry and Tyrone. From 776, the Uí Thuirtri had moved east of the River Bann and into the over-kingdom of Ulaid, and by 919 they had lost all links to the Airgíalla. \nUí Maic Cairthinn, meaning \"descendants of Cairthend\". Based south of Lough Foyle in north-western County Londonderry.\nUí Fiachrach Arda Sratha, meaning \"descendants of Fiachrach of Ard Straw\". Based at Ardstraw in modern-day County Tyrone. They became subject to the Cenél nEógain by the 12th-century, and expanded southwards into Fir Luírg, in County Fermanagh.\nUí Cremthainn, based in what is now parts of modern-day County Fermanagh, Monaghan, and Tyrone.\nUí Méith, based in modern-day County Monaghan.\nAirthir, meaning \"Easterners\".

{"topic": "Cum shot", "document": "A cum shot is the depiction of human ejaculation, especially onto another person. The term is usually applied to depictions occurring in pornographic films, photographs, and magazines. Unlike ejaculation in non-pornographic sex, cum shots typically involve ejeculation outside the receiver's body, allowing the viewer to see the ejaculation in progress. Facial cum shots (or \"facials\") are regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene. Cum shots may also depict ejaculation onto another performer's body, such as on the genitals, buttocks, chest or tongue.\n\nThe term is typically used by the cinematographer within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, and, since the 1970s, it has become a leitmotif of the hardcore genre. Two exceptions are softcore pornography, in which penetration is not explicitly shown, and \"couples erotica\", which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. Softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation. Cum shots typically do not appear in \"girl-girl\" scenes (female ejaculation scenes exist, but are relatively rare); orgasm is instead implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement.\n\nCum shots have become the object of fetish genres like bukkake, in which the cum shot replaces the sex act completely.\n\nTerminology\nA cum shot may also be called a cumshot, come shot, cum blast, pop shot or money shot.\n\nOriginally, in general film-making usage the term money shot was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of an explosion might be called the \"money shot\" of the film. The use of money shot to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. The meaning of the term money shot has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and TV industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films. For example, in TV talk shows, the term, borrowed from pornography, denotes a highly emotional scene, expressed in visible bodily terms.\n\nOrigin and features\n\nAlthough earlier pornographic films occasionally contained footage of ejaculation, it was not until the advent of hard-core pornography in the 1970s that the stereotypical cum shot scene became a standard feature—displaying ejaculation with maximum visibility. The 1972 film Behind the Green Door featured a seven-minute-long sequence described by Linda Williams, professor of film studies, as \"optically printed, psychedelically colored doublings of the ejaculating penis\". Steven Ziplow's The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography (1977) states:\n\nCum shot scenes may involve the female actor calling for the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. Cultural analysis researcher Murat Aydemir considers this one of the three quintessential aspects of the cum shot scene, alongside the emphasis on visible ejaculation and the timing of the cum shot, which usually concludes a hard-core scene.\n\nAs a possible alternative explanation for the rise of the cum shot in hardcore pornography, Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University and author of Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide notes that pornography actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.\n\nHealth risks\n\nTransmission of disease\nAny sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed. However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorizes semen as \"other potentially infectious material\" or OPIM.\n\nAside from other sexual activity that may have occurred prior to performing a facial, the risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner, there is almost no risk of contracting an STD. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher. Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.\n\nAllergic reactions\nIn rare cases, people have been known to experience allergic reactions to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma hypersensitivity. Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include hives and even difficulty breathing.\n\nOptions for prevention of semen allergy include avoiding exposure to seminal fluid by use of condoms and attempting desensitization.  Treatment options include diphenhydramine and/or an injection of epinephrine.\n\nCriticisms and responses\n\nOne critic of \"cum shot\" scenes in heterosexual pornography was the US porn star–turned–writer, director and producer Candida Royalle. She produced pornography films aimed at women and their partners that avoid the \"misogynous predictability\" and depiction of sex in \"...as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible.\" Royalle also criticizes the male-centredness of the typical pornography film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates.\n\nWomen's activist Beatrice Faust argued, \"since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism. This occurs in both homosexual and  pornography so that ejaculation cannot be interpreted as an expression of contempt for women only.\"\nShe goes on to say \"Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture.\"\n\nSexologist Peter Sándor Gardos argues that his research suggests that \"... the men who get most turned on by watching cum shots are the ones who have positive attitudes toward women\" (at the annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex in 1992). Later, at the World Pornography Conference in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that \"no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context. Harm or degradation does not reside in the image itself.\"\n\nCindy Patton, activist and scholar on human sexuality, argues that, in western culture, male sexual fulfillment is synonymous with orgasm and that the male orgasm is an essential punctuation of the sexual narrative. No orgasm, no sexual pleasure. No cum shot, no narrative closure. The cum shot is the period at the end of the sentence.\n\nIn her essay \"Visualizing Safe Sex: When Pedagogy and Pornography Collide\", Patton reached the conclusion that critics have devoted too little space to discovering the meaning that viewers attach to specific acts such as cum shots.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nPornography terminology\nEjaculation\nSexual acts", "instruction": " What is the average distance a man's semen travels during a cum shot in pornography?"}

{"topic": "Third Orbán Government", "document": "The third government of Viktor Orbán was the Government of Hungary between 6 June 2014 and 18 May 2018. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán formed his third cabinet after his party-alliance, Fidesz and its coalition partner, Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) altogether won a qualified majority in the 2014 parliamentary election.\n\nPolicy\n\nImmigration\n\nDuring the 2015 European migrant crisis the government initiated the erection of the Hungary-Serbia barrier to block entry of illegal immigrants. Just like the other Visegrád Group leaders, the government was against any compulsory EU long-term quota on redistribution of migrants.\n\nOn 24 February 2016 the prime minister announced that the government would hold a Referendum on whether to accept the European Union's proposed mandatory quotas for relocating migrants. He also said it is \"no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas\" and that they will be campaigning for \"no\" votes. Orbán argued that the quota system would \"redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do\". On 5 May, after examining the legal challenges, the Supreme Court (Kúria) allowed the holding of the referendum.\n\nIn the autumn of that year the no vote won with 3,362,224 votes or 98.36% of the total number of votes.\n\nFree Sunday\nFidesz and the Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary) has supported the restriction on Sunday shopping (\"free Sunday\", as they called) for a long time, citing Christian values. Parliament voted on the issue on December 14, 2014 and the law came into effect on March 15, 2015 (a Sunday on which shops would have been closed anyway, the day being a public holiday in Hungary). Public opinion was predominantly against the decision. Three polls done in the spring of 2015 registered an opposition of 64% (Szonda Ipsos), 62% (Medián) 59% (Tárki). By the end of May, according to a poll by Medián, 72% of those polled disliked the new law, even the majority of Fidesz-KDNP voters were against it. Opposition parties and private persons tried to start a public referendum several times. By November 2015 there were 16 such attempts, but none of them were approved, for various bureaucratic reasons, until in early 2016 one of these attempts, initiated by the Hungarian Socialist Party, was finally successful. The government, rather than being forced to hold the referendum (which could have been interpreted as a huge success for the opposition party, even though the law was opposed by the majority of Fidesz voters too) lifted the ban in April 2016.\n\nNGO Law\nOn 13 June 2017, The Hungarian Parliament Passed a Law Targeting Foreign-Funded NGOs. The law requires civil groups receiving foreign donations above a certain threshold to register as organizations funded from abroad. The law was passed 130 to 44, with 25 abstaining.\n\nParty breakdown\n\nBeginning of term\nParty breakdown of cabinet ministers in the beginning of term:\n\nEnd of term\nParty breakdown of cabinet ministers in the end of term:\n\nMembers of the Cabinet\n\nComposition\nFollowing the 2014 parliamentary election, Fidesz–KDNP gained 133 seats in the National Assembly.

{"topic": "The General (1998 film)", "document": "The General is an Irish crime film written and directed by John Boorman about Dublin crime boss Martin Cahill, who undertook several daring heists in the early 1980s and attracted the attention of the Garda Síochána, IRA and Ulster Volunteer Force. The film was shot in 1997 and released in 1998. Brendan Gleeson plays Cahill, Adrian Dunbar plays his friend Noel Curley, and Jon Voight plays Inspector Ned Kenny.\n\nPlot\nThe story of Dubliner Martin Cahill, who pulled off two daring robberies but came into conflict with members of his gang and attracted attention from the police and the IRA, and whose dealings with the UVF ultimately led to his downfall.\n\nCast\n Brendan Gleeson as Martin Cahill\n Adrian Dunbar as Noel Curley\n Sean McGinley as Gary\n Maria Doyle Kennedy as Frances\n Angeline Ball as Tina\n Jon Voight as Inspector Ned Kenny\n Eanna MacLiam as Jimmy\n Tom Murphy as Willie Byrne\n Paul Hickey as Anthony\n Tommy O'Neill as Paddy\n John O'Toole as Shea\n Ciarán Fitzgerald as Tommy\n Ned Dennehy as Gay\n Vinny Murphy as Harry (as Vinnie Murphy)\n Roxanna Williams as Orla\n\nProduction \nThe film is based on the book of the same name by Irish journalist Paul Williams, who is \"Special Correspondent\" for the Irish Independent. The director, John Boorman was one of Cahill's burglary victims. This event is dramatised in a scene in which Cahill breaks into a home, stealing a gold record and pilfering a watch from the wrist of a sleeping woman. The gold record, which Cahill later breaks in disgust after discovering it is not made of gold, was awarded for the score of Deliverance, Boorman's best-known film.\n\nFilming was at various locations around Dublin, including South Lotts and Ranelagh. Although shot in colour, the theatrical release of the film was presented in black-and-white for artistic reasons, while an alternate version of the desaturated original colour print was subsequently made available for television broadcast and home video. Asked why he chose to depict Cahill's life in black-and-white, Boorman said\n \nI love black-and-white, and since I was making the film independently — I borrowed the money from the bank — there was no one to tell me I couldn't. If I had made [The General] for a studio, they wouldn't let me do that. The other reason, the main reason, was because it was about recent events and people who were still alive. I wanted to give it a little distance. Black-and-white gives you that sort of parallel world. Also, it's very close to the condition of dreaming, to the unconscious. I wanted it to have this mythic level because I felt this character was an archetype. All throughout history, you find this rebel, this violent, funny, brilliant kind of character. I wanted to make that kind of connection, and black-and-white film helps. Up until the middle to late '60s, it was a choice to film in black-and-white or color. But then television became so vital to a film's finance, and television won't show black-and-white. So that killed it off, really.\n\nReception \nThe General holds an approval rating of 82% based on 49 reviews on website Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe film grossed £1.6 million in the UK and Ireland, the second highest-grossing Irish film of the year, behind The Butcher Boy. In the United States and Canada it grossed $1.2 million for a worldwide estimated total of $3.8 million.\n\nThe film garnered multiple awards for Gleeson's performance and Boorman's directing, with some critics speculating the former would earn an Academy Award nomination.

{"topic": "Terry Wolverton", "document": "Terry Wolverton (born 1954) is an American novelist, memoirist, poet, and editor. Her book Insurgent Muse: Life and Art at the Woman's Building, a memoir published in 2002 by City Lights Books, was named one of the \"Best Books of 2002\" by the Los Angeles Times, and was the winner of the 2003 Publishing Triangle Judy Grahn Award, and a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award. Her novel-in-poems Embers was a finalist for the PEN USA Litfest Poetry Award and the Lambda Literary Award.\n\nEarly years \nBorn August 23, 1954, in Cocoa Beach, Florida, Wolverton grew up in Detroit, Michigan.  \nHer grandmother, Elsba Mae Miller, a former English teacher, would often read and recite poetry to her, and Wolverton credits this for inspiring her love of language.  Even as a child Wolverton was interested in the arts, especially writing, music, and drama; she graduated from the Performing Arts curriculum of Cass Technical High School in 1972.\n\nEducation \nWolverton graduated from the Performing Arts curriculum of Cass Technical High School in 1972, after which she attended the University of Detroit as a student in its Bachelor of Fine Arts Theatre program.  In 1973, she transferred to the University of Toronto, majoring in Theatre, Psychology, and Women's Studies. In 1975, Wolverton participated in Sagaris, an independent institute for the study of feminist political theory. She ultimately received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in Creative Writing and Theater from Thomas Jefferson College, an experimental school based at Grand Valley State Colleges in Western Michigan, where she participated in its feminist Women, World, and Wonder program.\n\nWolverton also received a certificate from the Feminist Studio Workshop in Los Angeles and is a certified Kundalini yoga and meditation instructor.\n\nCareer \nWolverton moved to Los Angeles in 1976, enrolling in the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman's Building.  She spent the next thirteen years at the Woman's Building where, in addition to writing and performing, she was also instrumental in the Lesbian Art Project, the Incest Awareness Project, the Great American Lesbian Art Show (GALAS), a year-long performance project called \"An Oral Herstory of Lesbianism\", and a White Women's Anti-Racism Consciousness-Raising Group.  From 1987 to 1988, she served as the nonprofit organization's Executive Director.\n\nWolverton has taught performance skills and creative writing since 1977.  In 1986, she developed the Visions and Revisions Writing Program at Connexxus Women's Center/Centro de Mujeres.  In 1988, she launched the Perspectives Writing Program at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, where she taught until 1997. One notable writer that attended these workshops was Gil Cuadros, a Mexican American poet who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. Cuadros started attending her writing workshops for people with HIV. As a result of his participation, Cuadros published his collection of poetry and fiction, City of God(1994).\n\nIn 1997, Wolverton founded Writers at Work, a creative writing center where she continues to teach fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry, and to provide creative consultations to writers.\n\nIn 2007, Wolverton co-founded The Future of Publishing Think Tank, which convened writers, publishers, booksellers and publicists to consider new models for reaching readers. The Think Tank held discussions, offered workshops, conducted reader surveys, and compiled an online directory of literary resources in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe same year, she became an affiliate faculty member in the Master of Fine Arts writing program at Antioch University, where she currently works.\n\nAwards\n\nBibliography \nAuthor\nBlack Slip, Clothespin Fever Press, 1992,  (poetry) \nBailey's Beads, Faber & Faber, 1996,  (novel)\nMystery Bruise, Red Hen Press, 1999,  (poetry)\nInsurgent Muse: Life and Art at the Woman's Building, City Lights Books, 2002.

{"topic": "Royal Pembroke Militia", "document": "The Pembrokeshire Militia, later the Royal Pembroke Rifles, was an auxiliary regiment reorganised from earlier precursor units in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire during the 18th Century. Primarily intended for home defence, it served in Britain and Ireland through all Britain's major wars. It was converted into garrison artillery in 1853 and continued until it was disbanded in 1909.\n\nPembroke Trained Bands\n\nThe universal obligation to military service in the Shire levy was long established in England and   was extended to Wales. King Henry VIII called a 'Great Muster' in 1539, which showed the following available in the newly reorganised county of Pembrokeshire:\n County of Pembrokeshire: 1166 men available for service, of whom 139 had 'harness' (armour)\n Lordship of Haverfordwest: 454 (43 with harness)\n Tenants of Thomas Jones in both those places and in the Hundred of Dewisland: 380 with 4 'nags' (horses)\n Cilgerran Hundred: 254 \n\nThe legal basis of the militia was updated by two Acts of 1557 covering musters and the maintenance of horses and armour. The county militia was now under the Lord Lieutenant, assisted by the Deputy Lieutenants and Justices of the Peace (JPs). The entry into force of these Acts in 1558 is seen as the starting date for the organised Militia of England and Wales. Although the militia obligation was universal, it was clearly impractical to train and equip every able-bodied man, so after 1572 the practice was to select a proportion of men for the Trained Bands, who were mustered for regular training. During the Armada crisis of 1588 Pembrokeshire furnished 800 trained foot and 30 'petronel's (the petronel was an early cavalry firearm).\n\nIn the 16th Century little distinction was made between the militia and the troops levied by the counties for overseas expeditions. However, the counties usually conscripted the unemployed and criminals rather than send the trained bandsmen. Between 1585 and 1602 Pembrokeshire supplied 610 men for service in Ireland and 30 for the Netherlands. The levies were commanded by professional captains rather than local men: in 1601 a captain who had raised 100 troops in Gloucestershire was ordered to take the 50 from Pembrokeshire under his  command as well. The men were given 'conduct money' to get to the embarkation ports. This was recovered from the government, but replacing the weapons issued to the levies from the militia armouries was a heavy cost on the counties.\n\nWith the passing of the threat of invasion, the trained bands declined in the early 17th Century. Later, King Charles I attempted to reform them into a national force or 'Perfect Militia' answering to the king rather than local control. The Pembrokeshire Trained Bands of 1638 consisted of 557 men, 276 armed with muskets and 281 'Corslets' (body armour, signifying pikemen). They also mustered 57 horse. Part of this force may have been organised as the North Pembroke Trained Band. Pembrokeshire was ordered to send 300 men overland to Newcastle upon Tyne for the Second Bishops' War of 1640. However, substitution was rife and many of those sent on this unpopular service would have been untrained replacements.\n\nCivil Wars\nControl of the militia was one of the areas of dispute between Charles I and Parliament that led to the English Civil War. When open war broke out between the King and Parliament, neither side made much use of the trained bands beyond securing the county armouries for their own full-time troops. Most of Wales was under Royalist control for much of the war, and was a recruiting ground for the King's armies. However, Pembrokeshire was divided, with the coastal towns of Pembroke and Tenby leaning towards Parliament. These were vital for the Royal army to land supplies and reinforcements from Ireland. On 18 September 1643 during his campaign to take these two towns, the Earl of Carbery as the King's Lieutenant-General for Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire, summoned the Pembrokeshire TBs to Haverfordwest, where they declared for the King and were presumably absorbed into his army. However, Pembroke and Tenby were later recovered by Rowland Laugharne for Parliament.\n\nOnce Parliament had established full control in 1648 it passed new Militia Acts that replaced lords lieutenant with county commissioners appointed by Parliament or the Council of State. At the same time the term 'Trained Band' began to disappear in most counties. Under the Commonwealth and Protectorate the militia received pay when called out, and operated alongside the New Model Army to control the country. By 1651 the militias of the South Welsh counties appear to have been combined, with the 'South Wales Militia' being ordered to rendezvous at Gloucester to hold the city during the Worcester campaign.\n\nPembrokeshire Militia\nAfter the Restoration of the Monarchy, the Militia was re-established by the The King's Sole Right over the Militia Act 1661 under the control of the king's lords lieutenant, the men to be selected by ballot. This was popularly seen as the 'Constitutional Force' to counterbalance a 'Standing Army' tainted by association with the New Model Army that had supported Cromwell's military dictatorship.\n\nThe militia forces in the Welsh counties were small, and were grouped together under the direction of the Lord President of the Council of Wales. As Lord President, the Duke of Beaufort carried out a tour of inspection of the Welsh militia in 1684. On 11 August, when he inspected the Pembrokeshire Militia near Haverfordwest, it consisted of a regiment of foot ('all of firelocks', ie musketeers with no pikemen) and one Troop of horse. The 1697 militia returns showed the foot as 456 strong under Colonel Sir Thomas Stepney, 5th Baronet, High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, organised in seven companies (one commanded by the Mayor of Pembroke), and the troop of 36 horse under Captain Arthur Owen, MP for Pembrokeshire.\n\nGenerally the militia declined in the long peace after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Jacobites were numerous amongst the Welsh Militia, but they did not show their hands during the Risings of 1715 and 1745, and bloodshed was avoided.\n\n1757 reforms\n\nSeven Years' War\nUnder threat of French invasion during the Seven Years' War a series of Militia Acts from 1757 re-established county militia regiments, the men being conscripted by means of parish ballots (paid substitutes were permitted) to serve for three years. There was a property qualification for officers, who were commissioned by the lord lieutenant. An adjutant and drill sergeants were to be provided to each regiment from the Regular Army, and arms and accoutrements would be supplied when the county had secured 60 per cent of its quota of recruits.\n\nPembrokeshire was given a quota of 160 men to raise. Some of the Welsh counties were slow to complete their regiments: the problem was less with the other ranks raised by ballot than the shortage of men qualified to be officers, even after the requirements were lowered for Welsh counties. On 29 July 1758 Sir William Owen, 4th Baronet, of Orielton, the Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire, advertised for suitably qualified men to come forward, and must have obtained a sufficient number: he appointed his eldest son, Hugh Owen (later 5th Baronet) as colonel. The militia ballot was then enforced and the Pembrokeshire regiment received its arms on 7 September 1759. It was embodied for permanent service at Haverfordwest, Pembroke Town and Narberth", "instruction": " What was the role of the Royal Pembroke Militia during the Napoleonic Wars?"}
{"topic": "Cabaret Red Light", "document": "Cabaret Red Light was a theater group based in Philadelphia that performed vaudeville, burlesque, spoken word and puppet theater, set to original music by The Blazing Cherries. In their first season, between November 2008 and July 2009, Cabaret Red Light staged the series \"The Seven Deadly Sins\". Their second and third series (\"The Experiment\", about a cabaret that builds a time machine, and  \"The Seven Deadly Seas\", a pirate and gypsy-jazz show aboard the barquentine Gazela) began in 2010, and they recently performed the premiere of their ballet-and-burlesque version of The Nutcracker based on E. T. A. Hoffmann's original Gothic short story \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.\"\n\nCabaret Red Light's shows have been described as a blend of Agitprop and burlesque, an unlikely combination that earned them the title “The Best Marxist Girlie Show in Hell.” In their third show in the Seven Sins series, WRATH!, the group handed out pamphlets announcing the emergence worldwide of “pornographic socialism.” In the finale of their fifth show, GLUTTONY!, they immersed a showgirl (Annie A-Bomb) in liquid chocolate and invited members of the audience to lick it off. When Holly Otterbein of Philadelphia City Paper asked co-director Peter Gaffney about the politics of the show, he responded, \"The common ways in which we entertain ourselves — TV, movies, the Internet — involve sitting in a room by yourself. Compare that to the licking scene. It's the opposite. It's real people in a room experimenting with themselves and testing out their own limits.\" In other interviews, however, Gaffney has denied that Cabaret Red Light has any overtly political agenda. \"We think that theater has no business being in politics,\" he stated in an interview with Emily Orrson of The Daily Pennsylvanian, \"and neither does the government.\"\n\nCast members\nRegular members of the Cabaret Red Light cast include co-directors Anna Frangiosa and Peter Gaffney, Annie A-Bomb, Chris Aschman, Jim Boyle, Mike Corso, Kimberlie Cruse, Jay Davidson, Christine Fisler, Melissa Forgione (a.k.a. Melissa Bang-Bang), Rolf Lakaemper, Andrew Morris, Shoshanna Hill, Angela Schleinkofer (a.k.a. Satangela) and Evan Smoker. Previous members, technical engineers and guest performers include Josh Anderson, Ryan Berg, Jess Conda, Andy Cowles, Alexandra Cutler-Fetkewicz, Nick Gilette, Biz Goldhammer, Toni Guinyard, Mike Harkness, Heather Henderson, Brian Hopely, Nicki Jaine, Julie-Françoise Kruidenier, Lindsay Ouellette, Gina Pickton, Kaveh Saidi, Timaree Schmit, Michael Schupp, Benjamin Shwartz (as The Ringer), Jeff Smith (a.k.a.

Svedka von Schotz).\n\nHistory\nPeter Gaffney and Anna Frangiosa created Cabaret Red Light in 2008 in order to challenge the common perception that burlesque is not serious theater, and that politically engaged theater, on the other hand, is serious to a fault. Their influences include Anita Berber, NSK (the Neue Slowenische Kunst political art collective), Georges Brassens, Kurt Weill, Bulat Okudzawa, Bertolt Brecht, Aristophanes and Wilhelm Reich, as well as more contemporary artists and performance groups such as Julie Atlas Muz, Les Yeux Noirs, Frank Zappa, Bread and Puppet Theater, Tom Waits, the Yes Men and The Yard Dogs Road Show.\n\nIn November 2008 they performed their first show, \"Vanity\" as part of \" The Seven Deadly Sins\" series at L'Etage Cabaret in Philadelphia.\nBeginning in November, 2009, Plays and Players Theatre began presenting Cabaret Red Light's shows derived from their cabaret material. These shows were called \"The Takeover\", \"The Occupation\", and \"Lust\". \nThese elaborately staged productions have included such things as an army of showgirls armed with feathers and weapon props, and a 20-foot octopus puppet.\n\nIn the summers of 2010 and 2011 the company produced four shows in the series, \"The Seven Deadly Seas\". The shows were about pirates as corporate/capitalist figures and featured swordplay and burlesque. They premiered on the Gazela, a historic three masted tall ship. Shows were performed in Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore.\n\nTheir original production of Nutcracker premiered in December 2010 at Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia. The show featured an original adaptation of the original E. T. A. Hoffmann story by Peter Gaffney and Anna Frangiosa. Music by Rolf Lakamper.

{"topic": "Greek lyric", "document": "Greek lyric is the body of lyric poetry written in dialects of Ancient Greek.\nIt is primarily associated with the early 7th to the early 5th centuries BC, sometimes called the \"Lyric Age of Greece\", but continued to be written into the Hellenistic and Imperial periods.\n\nBackground\n\nLyric is one of three broad categories of poetry in classical antiquity, along with drama and epic, according to the scheme of the \"natural forms of poetry\" developed by Goethe in the early nineteenth century. (Drama is considered a form of poetry here because both tragedy and comedy were written in verse in ancient Greece.) Culturally, Greek lyric is the product of the political, social and intellectual milieu of the Greek polis (\"city-state\").\n\nMuch of Greek lyric is occasional poetry, composed for public or private performance by a soloist or chorus to mark particular occasions. The symposium (\"drinking party\") was one setting in which lyric poems were performed. \"Lyric\" was sometimes sung to the accompaniment of either a string instrument (particularly the lyre or kithara) or a wind instrument (most often the reed pipe called aulos). Whether the accompaniment was a string or wind instrument, the term for such accompanied lyric was melic poetry (from the Greek word for \"song\" melos). Lyric could also be sung without any instrumental accompaniment. This latter form is called meter and it is recited rather than sung, strictly speaking.\n\nModern surveys of \"Greek lyric\" often include relatively short poems composed for similar purposes or circumstances that were not strictly \"song lyrics\" in the modern sense, such as elegies and iambics. The Greeks themselves did not include elegies nor iambus within melic poetry, since they had different metres and different musical instruments. The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome offers the following clarification: \"'melic' is a musical definition, 'elegy' is a metrical definition, whereas 'iambus' refers to a genre and its characteristics subject matter. (...) The fact that these categories are artificial and potentially misleading should prompt us to approach Greek lyric poetry with an open mind, without preconceptions about what 'type' of poetry we are reading.\"\n\nGreek lyric poems celebrate athletic victories (epinikia), commemorate the dead, exhort soldiers to valor, and offer religious devotion in the forms of hymns, paeans, and dithyrambs. Partheneia, \"maiden-songs,\" were sung by choruses of maidens at festivals. Love poems praise the beloved, express unfulfilled desire, proffer seductions, or blame the former lover for a breakup. In this last mood, love poetry might blur into invective, a poetic attack aimed at insulting or shaming a personal enemy, an art at which Archilochus, the earliest known Greek lyric poet, excelled. The themes of Greek lyric include \"politics, war, sports, drinking, money, youth, old age, death, the heroic past, the gods,\" and hetero- and homosexual love.\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, the encyclopedic movement at Alexandria produced a canon of the nine melic poets: Alcaeus, Alcman, Anacreon, Bacchylides, Ibycus, Pindar, Sappho, Simonides, and Stesichorus. Only a small sampling of lyric poetry from Archaic Greece, the period when it first flourished, survives. For example, the poems of Sappho are said to have filled nine papyrus rolls in the Library of Alexandria, with the first book alone containing more than 1,300 lines of verse. Today, only one of Sappho's poems exists intact, with fragments from other sources that would scarcely fill a chapbook.\n\nMeters\n\nGreek poetry meters are based on patterns of long and short syllables (in contrast to English verse, which is determined by stress), and lyric poetry is characterized by a great variety of metrical forms. Apart from the shift between long and short syllables, stress must be considered when reading Greek poetry. The interplay between the metric \"shifts\", the stressed syllables and caesuras is an integral part of the poetry. It allows the poet to stress certain words and shape the meaning of the poem.\n\nThere are two main divisions within the meters of ancient Greek poetry: lyric and non-lyric meters. \"Lyric meters (literally, meters sung to a lyre) are usually less regular than non-lyric meters. The lines are made up of feet of different kinds, and can be of varying lengths. Some lyric meters were used for monody (solo songs), such as some of the poems of Sappho and Alcaeus; others were used for choral dances, such as the choruses of tragedies and the victory odes of Pindar.\"\n\nThe lyric meters' families are the Ionic, the Aeolic (based on the choriamb, which can generate varied kinds of verse, such as the glyconian or the Sapphic stanza), and the Dactylo-epitrite. The Doric choral songs were composed in complex triadic forms of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, with the first two parts of the triad having the same metrical pattern, and the epode a different form.\n\nBibliography\n\nTranslations\n\nAnthologies\n .\n .\n .\n\nLoeb Classical Library\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\nCritical editions\n\nLyric\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\nElegy and Iambus\n .\n .\n\nScholarship\n .\n .\n \n \n .\n  — translated from the French original of 1977 by D.

It was built from 1902 to 1903. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Enginemans Resthouse was built in 1902-03, when the Railway Commissioners resumed land on Brandling Street for the construction of a new barracks or dormitory to provide accommodation for train drivers, firemen and guards when they were away from their homes. The Eveleigh Railway Workshops, adjacent to the site, had a major locomotive depot for the storage and servicing of running steam locomotives. For such depots, it was normal practice to have a nearby \"barracks\" building to accommodate staff between shifts.\n\nIt replaced an earlier barrack which had been close to the running shed in the locomotive yard at the Eveleigh Railway Workshops, and had been requested by a proposed extension of the workshops. The Brandling Street site was selected due to its closeness to the workshops while being in a quiet neighbourhood. It was built at a cost of £2000.\n\nThe new accommodation was a large two-storey building of an expanded domestic design with 13 principal rooms, a kitchen, a dining area and a 6ft. verandah on three sides. The dining area was occasionally used as a conference room.\n\nThe building was used by the State Rail Authority's fire protection services during the 1980s and 1990s. It is now used as a private residence. It remains little altered from its original appearance and layout.\n\nDescription \n\nThe former Enginemans Resthouse is a two-storey Edwardian mansion on a quiet street featuring single or double storey late Victorian or Federation dwellings.\n\nThe building is of Federation/ Edwardian style. It is surrounded by gardens and has verandas on three sides, paved with flagstones. The corridors runs in the middle of the house at both floor levels. The middle entrance is flanked with 2 windows on the ground level and 5 windows are displayed at the first level. All external walls are rendered and painted and the hipped roof is clad with corrugated iron roofing.\n\nHeritage listing \n\nEnginemans Resthouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The Free Exercise Clause allows residents to practice any religion or no religion, and there is often controversy about separation of church and state and the balance between these two clauses when the government does or does not accommodate any particular religious practice (for example blue laws that require stores to be closed on Sunday, the Christian holy day).\n\nDirect consultation of any religious law, including any form of sharia, is relatively rare in U.S. jurisprudence and is generally limited to circumstances where the government is accommodating the religious belief of a specific person. This occurs mainly in matters of arbitration and family law.  For example, the law may allow parties to submit a dispute for binding arbitration to a mutually agreed-upon religious authority; mandatory arbitration by a specified or mutually-agreed arbitrator is also a common clause in commercial and labor union contracts.  Couples with the same religious beliefs may wish to construct marriage contracts and conduct divorces in concordance with those beliefs, and people may also wish to arrange wills and other financial matters in accordance with their own religious principles. If presented as evidence, devotion to peaceful religious principles, along with many other aspects of personality, is commonly considered when judging the character of a person before the law, for example during sentencing or a parole hearing.\n\nDespite the Free Exercise Clause, the 1878 Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. United States (which concerned the conflict of the Mormon practice of polygamy with anti-bigamy laws) affirmed that secular laws still apply when they contradict religious practices, unless a superseding law establishes a right to a religious accommodation.\n\nThe American Bar Association has opposed legislation banning foreign law or sharia as unnecessary, given that existing safeguards against foreign law already protect against rules that are contrary to American foreign policy, including discrimination on the basis of gender and religion.\n\nBackground of controversy\nIn June 2009, a family court judge in Hudson County, New Jersey denied a restraining order to a woman who testified that her husband, a Muslim, had raped her. The judge said he did not believe the man \"had a criminal desire to or intent to sexually assault\" his wife because he was acting in a way that was \"consistent with his practices.\" A state appeals court reversed his decision. Advocates of the ban in the U.S. have cited this case as an example of the need for the ban.\n\nAs of 2014, more than two dozen U.S. states have considered measures intended to restrict judges from consulting sharia law.  Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama have \"banned sharia,\"i.e., passed foreign law bans.  In 2010 and 2011, more than two dozen states \"considered measures to restrict judges from consulting Shariah, or foreign and religious laws more generally\". As of 2013, all but 16 states have considered such a law.\n\nIn November 2010, voters in Oklahoma approved a ballot measure to amend the state constitution to ban sharia from state courts. The law was then updated to include all foreign or religious laws.\nThe law was challenged by an official of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In November 2010 a federal judge ruled the law to be unconstitutional and blocked the state from putting it into effect.\nThe court found the ban had the potential to do harm to Muslims.  The invalidation of a will and testament using sharia instructions was an example.\nThat ruling and injunction were upheld by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on January 10, 2012.\n\nMissouri also passed a measure banning foreign law in 2013, but Gov. Jay Nixon vetoed the bill \"because of its potential impact on international adoptions.\"\n\nTwo other states banning sharia were North Carolina, which prohibited state judges from considering Islamic law in family cases in 2013, and Alabama, where voters passed an Amendment to the State Constitution (72% to 28%) to \"ban sharia\" in 2014.\n\nSupporters\nDavid Yerushalmi has been called the founder of the movement in America and is described by The New York Times as \"working with a cadre of conservative public-policy institutes and former military and intelligence officials\" and to pass legislation, \"a network of Tea Party and Christian groups\" as well as ACT! for America. This has been linked to the counter-jihad movement's efforts, along with legal campaigns to oppose mosque constructions across the US. According to him, the purpose of the anti-sharia movement is not to pass legislation banning sharia law in the courts but \"to get people asking this question, ‘What is Shariah?’”.\n\nIn 2011, Republicans Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann warned about what they saw as the threat of sharia law. During the lead-up to Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign 2012, he described sharia law as a \"mortal threat\" and called for its ban throughout America.  Sarah Palin has been quoted as saying that if shariah law “were to be adopted, allowed to govern in our country, it will be the downfall of America.”\n\nAt a press conference in the U.S. Capitol, some Republican members of the United States Congress endorsed a new memorandum, based on a Center for Security Policy (CSP) report, Shariah: The Threat To America.\n\nAnalysis\nA 2013 report by the Brennan Center for Justice warned that the bans may have the unintended effects of invalidating prenuptial agreements and court decisions made in other states where arbitrators may have taken into account Islamic, Jewish or Catholic legal norms. Randy Brinson, the president of the Christian Coalition of Alabama, criticized the ban in Alabama, calling it \"redundant and a waste of time\".\n\nHistorian Justin Tyler Clark argues that the rise of an anti-Sharia movement in the US, more than a decade after the September 11 attacks, is in part a reaction to increasing political correctness in the American society. Clark compares the phenomenon to the 19th century anti-Catholic movement in the US, which, he writes, rose largely in reaction to changes in middle-class American etiquette, interpreted by the nativists as encroachment of an alien ideology on their own social norms.\n\nAccording to Sadakat Kadri, the ban on sharia laws notwithstanding, \"the precepts of Islamic law ... have judicial force in the United States already\", among Muslims who have had a dispute settled by Muslim conciliators. The 1925 Federal Arbitration Act allows Muslims, Christians, Jews, etc. to use religious tribunals to arbitrate disagreements and \"the judgments that result are given force of law by state and federal courts\". The statute \"preempts inconsistent state legislation\", such as laws to ban sharia.\n\nFor American Jews who choose to obey its rulings, a Beth Din (Rabbinical court) \"may not merely decide the legal rights of devout Jews; in some cases, it may formally forbid believers from pursuing complaints through the secular judicial system without prior authorization from a rabbi.  And Muslims can also have their inheritance, business, and matrimonial disputes sorted out by Islamic scholars, who attempt to decide them according to the sharia.\"  While the US Congress could in theory repeal the act, it could not ban arbitration by Muslims while leaving other religious conciliators free to continue their work. \"Any reform would have to impact equally on all faith communities, and it is not only Muslims who would object if federal legislators presumed to do that.\"\n\nCanada\nIn 2003-2004, there was a controversy in Ontario over the possibility of Islamic arbitration tribunals. In 1991, Ontario had passed the Arbitration Act, which allowed for legal", "instruction": " What is the current status of legislation banning sharia law in provinces other than Alberta and North Carolina in Canada?"}

{"topic": "Maya monarchs", "document": "Maya monarchs, also known as Maya kings and queens, were the centers of power for the Maya civilization. Each Maya city-state was controlled by a dynasty of kings. The position of king was usually inherited by the oldest son.\n\nSymbols of power\nMaya kings felt the need to legitimize their claim to power. One of the ways to do this was to build a temple or pyramid. Tikal Temple I is a good example. This temple was built during the reign of Yikʼin Chan Kʼawiil. Another king named Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal would later carry out this same show of power when building the Temple of Inscriptions at Palenque. The Temple of Inscriptions still towers today amid the ruins of Palenque, as the supreme symbol of influence and power in Palenque.\n\nSuccession\nMaya kings cultivated godlike personas. When a ruler died and left no heir to the throne, the result was usually war and bloodshed. King Pacal's precursor, Pacal I, died upon the battlefield. However, instead of the kingdom erupting into chaos, the city of Palenque, a Maya capital city in southern Mexico, invited in a young prince from a different city-state. The prince was only twelve years old.\n\nExpansion\nPacal and his predecessors not only built elaborate temples and pyramids. They expanded their city-state into a thriving empire. Under Yikʼin Chan Kʼawiil, Tikal conquered Calakmul and the other cities around Tikal, forming what could be referred to as a super city-state. Pacal achieved in creating a major center for power and development.\n\nResponsibilities\nA Maya king was expected to be an excellent military leader. He would often carry out raids against rival city-states. The Maya kings also offered their own blood to the gods. The rulers were also expected to have a good mind to solve problems that the city might be facing, including war and food crises.\n\nMaya kings were expected to ensure the gods received the prayers, praise and attention they deserved and to reinforce their divine lineage. They did this by displaying public rituals such as processions through the streets of their cities. A more private ritual was that of blood sacrifice, which was done by Lords and their wives.\n\nKnown rulers of Mayan city-states in the Classic Period\n\nAguas Calientes\n c.790: Chak Lakamtuun\n\nAguateca\n ?-770: Ucha'an K'an B'alam – father of Tan Te' Kinich, ruled in the 8th century AD.\n 770-c.802: Tan Te' K'inich – son of Ucha'an K'an B'alam\n\nAltun Ha\n 4 December 584-?: Til Man K'inich\n\nLa Amelia\n\nBonampak\n\nCalakmul \n\nThe kings of Calakmul were known as k'uhul kan ajawob () (\"Divine Lords of the Snake Kingdom\").

{"topic": "International Criminal Court investigation in Venezuela", "document": "A preliminary examination by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to analyze possible crimes against humanity committed in Venezuela is currently open. A preliminary examination was previously opened in 2006, but closed after concluding that the requirements to start an investigation had not been met. In February 2018, the ICC announced that it would open preliminary probes into alleged crimes against humanity performed by Venezuelan authorities since at least April 2017. In 2020, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC stated that it believed there was a \"reasonable basis\" to believe that \"since at least April 2017, civilian authorities, members of the armed forces and pro-government individuals have committed the crimes against humanity\", and on 2021 ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan announced the opening of an investigation regarding the situation in the country.\n\nBackground \nBy 2006, the Office of the Prosecutor received twelve communications concerning the situation in Venezuela, most of them related to crimes allegedly committed by the Venezuelan government and associated forces and one to crimes alleged to have been committed by opposition groups, but the examination was closed on 9 February 2006 because it was concluded that the Rome Statute requirements to seek authorization to initiate an investigation in the country had not been satisfied.\n\nPreliminary examination\n\n2018 \nIn February 2018, the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced that it would open preliminary probes into alleged crimes against humanity performed by Venezuelan authorities.\n\nIn May 2018, a Panel of Independent International Experts appointed by the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) concluded that reasonable grounds existed to believe that crimes against humanity had been committed in Venezuela dating back to at least 12 February 2014 and recommended that; the Secretary General of the OAS, Luis Almagro, should submit the report and the evidence collected by the General Secretariat of the OAS to the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC, that he should invite States Parties to the Rome Statute to refer the situation of Venezuela to the Office of the Prosecutor and to call for the opening of an investigation into the facts set forth in the report, in accordance with Article 14 of the Rome Statute.\n\nOn 27 September 2018, six states parties to the Rome Statute: Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru, referred the situation in Venezuela since 12 February 2014 to the ICC, requesting the Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to initiate an investigation on crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the territory. On 28 September, the Presidency assigned the situation to Pre-Trial Chamber I. This was the first time that member States had sought an investigation of potential crimes that took place entirely on the territory of another country.\n\n2020 \nNicolás Maduro's Foreign Minister, Jorge Arreaza, filed a complaint in the ICC against the United States on 13 February 2020, arguing that policy of sanctions has resulted in crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Bensouda stated that she informed the ICC Presidency of the referral pursuant to the regulations of the court to enable the assignment of the situation to a Pre-Trial Chamber, noting that the two referrals \"appear to overlap geographically and temporally and may therefore warrant assignment to the same Pre-Trial Chamber\", but \"that this should not prejudice a later determination on whether the referred scope of the two situations is sufficiently linked to constitute a single situation\".\n\nIn September 2020, the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela published their findings and cited evidence of unlawful executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture in the country since 2014. The authors called for further action by the International Criminal Court, along with justice and reparations for the victims and their families.\n\nOn 2 December 2020, the Organization of American States General Secretariat released a 145-page report expanding on the 2018 report by the Panel of Independent Experts that concluded there was a reasonable basis to believe crimes against humanity were being committed in Venezuela, noting that since 2018 the crimes against humanity in Venezuela had increased in scale, scope, and severity, while criticizing the failure of the Prosecutor of the ICC to conduct her preliminary examination expeditiously and to open an investigation \"despite overwhelming evidence of crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction\". Two days afterwards, the Office of the Prosecutor responded that it was aware and that it would study the Organisation of American States report and assuring the Office that it sought to \"complete preliminary examinations within the shortest time possible\", but regretting \"the tone and manner of the report\" and that Prosecutor and the Office \"would not allow external attempts\" to interfere with the process. OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro replied shortly after, declaring that the OAS understood due process and that they had \"the utmost respect\" for the International Criminal Court, but that three years was far too long \"not for the OAS\", but for the victims in Venezuela.\n\nOn 14 December, the Office of the Prosecutor released a report on the office's year activities, stating that it believed there was a \"reasonable basis\" to believe that \"since at least April 2017, civilian authorities, members of the armed forces and pro-government individuals have committed the crimes against humanity.\" and that it expected to decide in 2021 whether to open an investigation or not.\n\n2021 \nIn May 2021, Maduro's Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, admitted that Fernando Albán, Caracas councilman who died in 2018 while he was detained in the headquarters of the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN), did not commit suicide as initially reported by government officials, but killed, and that during the 2017 Venezuelan protests student Juan Pablo Pernalete was killed with a tear gas canister by security forces, something initially denied by senior officials. William Saab would also accuse the ICC \"process of lacking transparency\". Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, described the case against Venezuela in the ICC as a \"great farce\". The opposition National Assembly headed by Juan Guaidó declared that William Saab sought to prevent the ICC from acting and condemned that command chain was not being investigated.\n\nOn July 2, the Pre-Trial Chamber dismissed a request for \"judicial control\" filed by William Saab, who alleged a lack of complementarity and collaboration of the ICC Office of the Prosecutor with Venezuela. The Chamber dismissed the appeal for its inadmissibility and for being clearly premature.\n\nOn 4 November 2021 prosecutor Karim Khan announced the opening of an investigation regarding the situation in Venezuela.\n\nInvestigation\n\n2022 \nOn 17 January 2022, the Prosecutor's Office indicated that the administration of Nicolás Maduro had three months to submit its report on investigations into crimes against humanity committed in the country. On 7 April, Tarek William Saab assured that \"there is no need\" for an investigation by the International Criminal Court.\n\nAfter failing to provide the requested information, in an attempt to delay the ICC investigation, Venezuela asked Karin Khan on April 15 that his office defer the investigation into possible crimes against humanity, claiming that state institutions were or have investigated such crimes. On April 20, Khan briefed a panel of ICC judges on Venezuela's request, stating that his office would ask the judges to reject the request.\n\nOn 1 November, Karin Khan requested the reopening of the Venezuela investigation, just over six months after Venezuela asked the ICC to defer its investigation, stating that \"the deferral requested by Venezuela, at this stage, is not justified, and that the resumption of the investigation should be authorized.\"\n\nIn response to the prosecutor's request, the Venezuelan State sent a document on November 10, opposing the direct participation of victims and their representatives and requesting that the investigation be limited to summaries prepared by the ICC's Office of Public Counsel for Victims and only to cases presented by the Office of the Prosecutor. In the document, Venezuela also asks the ICC judges not to allow the participation in the proceedings of Canada, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru, the member states that referred the situation of Venezuela to the Court. The NGO PROVEA warned that the communiqué was part of the Maduro government's dilatory strategy to paralyze the ICC prosecutor's investigation for as long as possible, expressing: \"This communication ratifies the Venezuelan authorities' contempt for the victims and their claims for justice, as well as", "instruction": " What specific actions or measures has the International Criminal Court taken so far in its investigation into alleged crimes against humanity in Venezuela since the opening of the investigation in 2021?"}

She was Miss Jamaica World 1973, and the second runner-up in the Miss World pageant that same year.\n\nEarly life\nYuen was born to a Hakka Chinese Jamaican family in Kingston. She began playing tennis while in school. She studied marketing management in Miami, Florida. In 1973, she was 21 years old and working as a salesgirl.\n\nPageant wins\nYuen entered the Miss Jamaica pageant that year, breaking an \"informal colour line\" which had seen women of Chinese descent voluntarily restricting themselves from participation in such events. On 5 August 1973, she was named the pageant's winner. She went on to a third-place finish in the Miss World 1973 pageant behind Evangeline Pascual of the Philippines and Marjorie Wallace, the pageant's first American winner. However, Wallace was fired from the Miss World duties after the pageant; organisers extended an offer to Pascual to complete the duties of Miss World for the remainder of the year, but without holding the title; when Pascual turned down that offer, organisers next turned to Yuen, who accepted. During the course of her duties, she expressed concern that \"winners find themselves coping with financial commitments out of their reach\".\n\nYuen's strong showing in the Miss World pageant elevated her to the status of a national hero in Jamaica, but also exposed her to controversy. While Yuen was growing up, the Chinese Benevolent Association had held annual Miss Chinese Jamaican pageants, but such \"openly racialised\" events ceased in 1962 after charges from Afro-Jamaican journalists that the ethnic pride on display there was \"unpatriotic\" and \"un-Jamaican\". After her win, she was forced into the awkward position of strenuously denying any connection to her Chinese heritage so that she would not \"disrupt the official picture of the country's identity\", going as far as to make public proclamations that she preferred Jamaican national dishes like ackee and saltfish and entirely disliked Chinese cuisine. Two years later, Jamaica withdrew from participation in Miss World and Miss Universe events amidst public complaints that black contestants faced discrimination from judges and a lack of coverage by British news media.\n\nLater career\nYuen herself went on to become a partner in Manufacturing Company, Ltd., where she worked as a costume designer; she won the Distinguished Salesman of the Year award from the Kingston Gleaner in 1974. She later married fellow Chinese Jamaican Warwick Lyn, a reggae producer best known as the protégé of Leslie Kong, and emigrated to the United States with him. There, she was the organiser of the Miss Jamaica Miami beauty pageant. She would later return to Jamaica, where she worked as a manager for American Airlines in Montego Bay.

{"topic": "Sisters of the Infant Jesus", "document": "The Sisters of the Infant Jesus, also known as the Dames of Saint Maur, are a religious institute of the Catholic Church originating from Paris, France and dedicated to teaching.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nIn 1659 Barré, who was a respected scholar within his Order, was sent to the monastery of the Order in Rouen. He became widely known as a preacher and his sermons attracted a large audience. In 1662 Barré saw the need for the education of the poor in France.\n\nFrance in the late 17th century was suffering from the effects of the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659) and a terrible plague. As a result of his efforts to promote a planned parish mission in the nearby village of Sotteville-lès-Rouen, Barré came to see the suffering of the local population. To enable parents to attend the mission, Barré asked two young women to come and help with the children. One was a local resident, Françoise Duval, 18 years old, the other was Marguerite Lestocq, then aged 20, who, like him, was from Amiens and with whom he had family connections.\n\nHe saw the need to make basic education more accessible to all. There were hardly any schools for girls and very few for boys. Most primary school teachers were poorly educated and religious education was almost non-existent; there was profound ignorance of the Catholic faith. In 1662, half the children in Rouen died of famine. Many were homeless and wandered the streets as beggars and, for some, prostitution became one of the few means of livelihood available.\n\nThey began to give daily classes to young girls in a room which they were allowed to use, spending that year in this work. Soon three other young women joined them, and two separate schools were opened. Barré would visit the classes frequently, guiding the young women in how to teach and deal with both the children and their parents, drawing upon his own rigorous education under the Jesuits and his experience as a professor. He taught them the value of “instruction and education” and from the beginning he trained the young teachers to respect the uniqueness of each child and to develop each one’s potential. The teachers were to speak in a humble, gentle and simple manner so that even the youngest could understand, and they were to teach only what they themselves had adequately grasped.\n\nAs the enrollment increased, more schools were established, and four years later, the ladies in charge of these schools began to live in a community under a Superior. This was the beginning of a religious congregation whose main work was the education of the poor.\n\nThe year 1666 saw the founding of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Infant Jesus. After several years of teaching in the schools, the five young women were invited by Barré to consider becoming part of a committed community. After some reflection, they felt that they were indeed called to this way of life and agreed. These women were not bound by religious vows or confined to a cloister. They were free to serve the local community and provide free education for poor children. They committed themselves to this in a legal document drawn up in 1669, becoming called the Charitable Teachers of the Infant Jesus (). As part of their living in trust in God, it was established that the material needs of the schools were to be handled by women outside the new community.\n\nExpansion and division\nDue to his declining health, in 1675 Barré was sent to the Minim monastery in Paris. Though limited in his activities, he promoted new foundations of his \"charitable schools of Providence\", starting with two, Saint Jean en Grèves and Saint Nicolas des Champs, training teachers, both men and women for them. He urged his teachers not to wait until pupils arrived at the school; they were to seek out especially those who might be at risk. He also set up trade schools so that girls could earn a living. Again, the education offered was to be entirely free and any profit derived from the pupils’ work was to go to them.\n\nIn 1677 Barré began to send teachers to other locations in France, starting with his native Picardy, reaching as far as New France in North America. These women were not part of a religious institute, and so were free to serve their local communities as needed, without the barriers that status would have imposed at that time.\n\nAround that time, he acquired a house located on the Rue Saint Maur in the 6th arrondissement of Paris (now called the Rue de l'Abbé Grégoire), which was to become the motherhouse of the Institute. In 1677 a convent was established in Rue Saint Maur, Paris (ii) and the Sisters were subsequently known as the \"Dames of St. Maur\". In 1678, Barré founded a novitiate for the sisters on the Seine.\n\nThe Daughters of Providence were members of a Catholic religious congregation for women founded in 1643, by a pious widow, Marie Polaillon (née de Lumague) under a Rule of Life drawn up by Vincent de Paul. The Daughters would profess annual vows of obedience, chastity, service and stability. In 1681 several houses of the congregation merged with the Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, becoming the Sisters of St. Maur and of Providence. A number of ‘Little Charitable Schools’ were established throughout France. In 1683 Mother Françoise Duval, one of the foundresses, was sent to open a school in Lisieux. At the time of Barré's death in 1686, there were over 100 schools being operated by the Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus throughout France.\n\nThroughout his life, Barré had refused to allow the schools to accept benefices as a means of support, determined to place his trust in God alone, and was followed in this commitment by the teachers of the Institute. Upon his death, however, the lay trustees in Paris and Rouen, who were in charge of the finances of the schools and the teachers who staffed them, strongly disagreed over whether or not to continue this practice.\n\nThis was eventually referred to the royal court, and, in 1691, King Louis XIV divided the Institute into three independent groups, with motherhouses in Rouen, Paris and Lisieux. \nThe Sisters in the original communities became known as the Sisters of Providence of Rouen and in 1921 became a congregation of diocesan right, under the authority of the local bishops where they served, with a missionary outreach in Madagascar and Central Africa.\nThe group based in Lisieux also became a diocesan congregation.\nThe Sisters of St Maur in Paris became an institute of pontifical right with communities in five continents.\n\nCurrent era\n\nSoutheast Asia\nIn 1849 a Catholic missionary in the Straits Settlements, Reverend Father Jean-Marie Beurel, a native of Saint-Brieuc in France, suggested to the colonial governor, William John Butterworth, that it might be worthwhile to found a charitable organisation for girls next to the Church in Victoria Street. In August 1852, Beurel bought the house at the corner of Victoria Street and Bras Basah Road. Beurel then appealed to the Superior General of the congregation in France for Sisters to run a school.\n\nMalaysia\nFour Sisters were sent to the East. After a long and perilous voyage, one had died at sea, three of them landed at Penang in April 1852. That same year, the three Sisters established a convent that contained an orphanage and school in Penang. In September 1852, the Congregation sent four Sisters to Penang, with Mother Mathilde Raclot in charge, to guide and support the group of sisters who had arrived earlier. The school, Convent Light Street (Malay: SMK Convent Lebuh Light), is Penang's oldest girls' school and has occupied its current site along Light Street near historic George Town for over 150 years. While on the peninsula, the Sisters continued establishing schools with help from the local community such as Kuala Lumpur's oldest girls' school Convent Bukit Nanas and the only Chinese convent girls school Convent Datuk Keramat in Penang. In 1952, St Bernadette's convent school was built in Pusing Road, Batu Gajah Perak with land donated and funds raised from communities. During World War II, the Japanese invaded Malaya and either took over or closed down many such mission schools, notably the iconic Convent Primary School in the hills of Tanah Rata.

{"topic": "The Bulleteers", "document": "The Bulleteers (1942) is the fifth of seventeen animated Technicolor short films based upon the DC Comics character of Superman, originally created by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster. This animated short was created by Fleischer Studios. The story runs about nine minutes and covers Superman's adventures as he defends the city against a villainous gang called \"The Bulleteers\", who are equipped with a bullet-shaped rocket car. It was originally released on March 27, 1942.\n\nPlot\nThe story begins as the clock strikes midnight. A strange, bullet-shaped rocket car blows right through the police department, leaving an explosion in its wake. The paper the next day reports the destruction of the building and the bafflement of the police.  Perry White calls Lois Lane and Clark Kent into his office. Just as he is explaining the report, the sound of a loudspeaker comes in through the window. The leader of the \"Bulleteers\", as Lois later calls them, is shown announcing from his hideout atop a mountain outside of town, the demands of his gang. Over the speaker, Clark, Lois, Perry, and the rest of the town hear it: \"Turn over the city treasury or other municipal buildings will be next as their last warning!\"\n\nLater that day, Lois asks the mayor what he is doing about the problem. The mayor announces that he will not be swayed by criminals. At the same time, policemen all over town set up sandbag fortifications for their machine guns and searchlights in preparation for the Bulleteers. At midnight, the gang strikes again, first destroying the town's power plant, bullets from defending policemen bouncing harmlessly off the bullet car's sleek surface. Lights in the Daily Planet flicker on and off, and Lois takes off in a car to get closer to the scene, leaving Clark behind. Clark takes the opportunity to enter a nearby phone booth and don his Superman costume.\n\nThe Bulleteers take aim now at the city's treasury building, but Superman steps in front of them and knocks the rocket car off course. As they struggle to regain control, he leaps in the air and grabs its front trying again to force it off-course, but the Bulleteers, through wild maneuvering, manage to shake him off the car to the ground below. Superman lunges to keep them from the treasury, only to arrive too late. Piles of rubble from the explosion bury him.\n\nLois Lane arrives at the scene in time to see the gang throwing bags of money into their car. She sneaks into its cockpit and tries to smash the controls with a wrench, but the gang returns, taking off with her. Superman, meanwhile, emerges from the rubble and chases after the car, grasping it by one of its retractable wings, and then by its tail fins to throw it off course. As it spirals downward, he claws his way to the cockpit, rips it open, and pulls Lois and the three gangsters out. The car crashes to the ground far below.\n\nThe newspaper on the next day reports Superman's heroic feat and the gangsters' arrest for their rampage. Reading it, Clark remarks, \"Nice going, Lois. Another great scoop for you\". Lois replies, \"It was easy, thanks to Superman\".\n\nCast\nBud Collyer as Clark Kent/Superman, Bulleteer, Police Officer, Printer\nJoan Alexander as Lois Lane\nJulian Noa as Perry White, Mayor\nJackson Beck as the Narrator\n\nAppearances\nIn Superman: Doomsday, the restored bullet car appears as one of Superman's trophies in his Fortress of Solitude.\nThe line \"We won't be intimidated by criminal threats\" has been used in various promos for the action cartoon block Toonami.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Bulleteers at the Internet Archive\nThe Bulleteers at the Internet Movie Database\n\n1942 short films\n1942 animated films\n1940s American animated films\n1940s animated short films\n1940s animated superhero films\nSuperman animated shorts\nFleischer Studios short films\nShort films directed by Dave Fleischer\nFlying cars in fiction\nParamount Pictures short films\nRotoscoped films\n1940s English-language films\nAmerican animated short films", "instruction": " What is the backstory of the Bulleteers gang and their motivation for attacking the city in The Bulleteers (1942) animated short?"}

{"topic": "James Laxer", "document": "James Robert Laxer (22 December 1941 – 23 February 2018), also known as Jim Laxer, was a Canadian political economist, historian, public intellectual, and political activist who served as a professor at York University. Best known as co-founder of the Waffle, on whose behalf he ran for the leadership of the New Democratic Party in 1971, he was the author of more than two dozen books, mostly on Canadian political economy and history.\n\nEarly life and family\nLaxer was born in Montreal, Quebec, on 22 December 1941 and was the son of Edna May (née Quentin) and Robert Laxer, a psychologist, professor, author, and political activist. His father was Jewish and his mother was from a Protestant family. Both were members of the Communist Party of Canada and its public face, the Labor-Progressive Party, with Robert Laxer being a national organizer for the party. The Laxers left the party, along with many other members, following Khrushchev's Secret Speech revealing Joseph Stalin's crimes, and the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. James Laxer wrote about his experiences growing up during this period in his memoir Red Diaper Baby: A Boyhood in the Age of McCarthyism. His father came to serve as a significant influence on his political worldview.\n\nHis paternal grandfather was a rabbi and his maternal grandfather was a minister and Christian missionary to China, where Laxer's mother was born. His brother, Gordon Laxer, became a political economist, author, and founder of the Parkland Institute.\n\nHe received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto and Master of Arts (following approval of his thesis French-Canadian Newspapers and Imperial Defence, 1899–1914 in 1967) and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Queen's University. He was an active student journalist both at The Varsity at the University of Toronto and later at the Queen's Journal and was elected president of Canadian University Press in 1965.\n\nLaxer married three times. He married Diane Taylor in 1965, from whom he was divorced in 1969. He married Krista Mäeots in 1969 with whom he had two children: Michael and Katherine (known as \"Kate\"). They were separated at the time of her death in 1978. Laxer married Sandra Price in 1979 with whom he had two more children: Emily and Jonathan.\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1969, Laxer, along with his father Robert Laxer, Mel Watkins, and others, founded the Waffle, a left-wing group influenced by the New Left, the anti–Vietnam War movement, and Canadian economic nationalism, that tried to influence the direction of the New Democratic Party (NDP). Laxer was a principal author of their Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada in 1969 alongside Ed Broadbent and Gerald Caplan. The manifesto was debated at the 1969 federal NDP convention and was rejected by the delegates in favour of a more moderate declaration.\n\nIn 1971, Laxer ran for the leadership of the federal NDP and shocked the convention by winning one-third of the vote on the fourth and final ballot against party stalwart David Lewis. The Waffle was ultimately forced out of the NDP and briefly became a political party under the name Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada. Laxer and other Wafflers unsuccessfully ran for Parliament in 1974. This electoral failure led to the Waffle's demise, and Laxer concentrated on his work at York University, where he was a professor of political science for 47 years, and in broadcasting.\n\nIn 1981, he was hired as director of research for the federal NDP, but left in controversy in 1983 when he published a report critiquing the party's economic policy as being \"out of date\".\n\nAcademic, writer, and broadcaster\nLaxer hosted The Real Story, a nightly half-hour current affairs program on TVOntario in the early 1980s. He also variously wrote a column and op-ed pieces for the Toronto Star from the 1980s until shortly before his death, as well as op-ed pieces for The Globe and Mail. He also played \"Talleyrand\", a mock political insider, on CBC Radio's Morningside in the 1980s.\n\nLaxer co-wrote and presented the five-part National Film Board documentary series Reckoning: The Political Economy of Canada in 1986, which examined Canada's economic and political relationships with the United States and Canada's place in the changing global economy. Laxer and his co-writer won a Gemini Award in 1988 for Best Writing in an Information/Documentary  Program or Series for episode one of Reckoning titled \"In Bed with an Elephant\". The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation refused to air the series due to its critical view of free trade with the United States, which was being negotiated at the time, and it aired instead on TVOntario and other educational channels in Canada as well as a number of PBS stations in the United States.\n\nA democratic socialist, Laxer believed that Canadian economic nationalism was a progressive force against the United States and American imperialism. He wrote extensively about the influence of American multinational corporations in the Canadian economy, particularly in the oil and gas industry, and his agitation helped lead to the creation of Petro-Canada. The creation of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the Canadian Development Corporation in the 1970s is also attributed in part to the work of Laxer, Watkins, and the Waffle. In the 1980s he strongly opposed the adoption of the Canada–US Free Trade Agreement, though he still believed that free trade agreements were capable of being used to the advantage of the political left through the entrenchment of social charters.\n\nLaxer died suddenly and unexpectedly in Paris of heart-related problems on 23 February 2018 while in Europe researching a book on Canada's role in the Second World War.\n\nSelected works\n\nSee also\n Canadian Dimension\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nWorks cited\n\nExternal links\nJames Laxer blog\nJames Laxer at rabble.ca\nJames Laxer's profile at York University\n\n1941 births\n2018 deaths\n20th-century Canadian historians\n21st-century Canadian historians\nCanadian Broadcasting Corporation people\nCanadian columnists\nCanadian economists\nCanadian nationalists\nCanadian political scientists\nCanadian radio personalities\nCanadian socialists\nCanadian television hosts\nCanadian Screen Award winners\nHistorians of Canada\nIndependent candidates in the 1974 Canadian federal election\nJewish Canadian politicians\nJewish socialists\nJournalists from Montreal\nNew Democratic Party people\nCanadian democratic socialists\nPoliticians from Montreal\nPoliticians from Toronto\nPost-Keynesian economists\nQueen's University at Kingston alumni\nToronto Star people\nUniversity of Toronto alumni\nWriters about globalization\nWriters from Montreal\nWriters from Toronto\nAcademic staff of York University\nJewish Canadian journalists\nJewish Canadian filmmakers", "instruction": " What specific policies did James Laxer advocate for in his critique of the Canadian-American Free Trade Agreement in the 1980s?"}

But none of these locomotives were ever actually built.\n\nBackground\nThe planning of the JNR Class C63 began around 1955.  Electrification for the locomotive developed slowly due to financial difficulties at JNR. The company was not experienced with diesel locomotives, and it lacked test facilities for non-steam engines. Development of the new diesel locomotive was proposed because existing models were aging and travel demand was increasing.\n\nCancellation\n\nIn 1956, the design drawing was completed. A prototype was to be manufactured, and a manufacturing order was to be issued.\n\nIn 1958, JNR, in its \"Power Modernization Plan\", planned to eliminate the steam locomotive in 15 years from fiscal year 1960.

Since JNR had converted to the policy of abolishing the steam locomotive, the company decided to cancel the C63.\n\nAt the Koriyama Plant (currently the Koriyama General Vehicle Center), a 1/5-scale live steam replica was produced based on the design documents, mainly to demonstrate the steam locomotive technology to the young staff; the miniature is currently used during special events.

His father was an insurance broker.\n\nIn 1880 he emigrated to New Zealand. In September 1882 he leased Tutira, a sheep station in central Hawke's Bay, which was his home for the rest of his life. In 1901 Guthrie-Smith married Georgina Meta Dennistoun Brown in Scotland. Their daughter, Barbara, was born in 1903.\n\nAfter the First World War he met Beatrix Dobie who was exhibiting her work at the Canterbury Society of Arts Gallery. They formed the connection that would lead to her providing the illustrations for his book Tutira: The Story of a New Zealand Sheep Station.\n\nHis books and photography, especially Tutira: The Story of a New Zealand Sheep Station, graphically document the impacts of human activity on New Zealand's unique environment.\n\nTutira: The Story of a New Zealand Sheep Station''' was published in 1921 (and reprinted in 1926 with a new preface, map and index). It documented the impact of humans on New Zealand's environment in an easy reading, non-scientific yet accurate manner. It is an internationally acclaimed classic of ecological writing and was New Zealand's first significant environmentalist publication. In 2003 Michael King wrote:“Our first ecological book, and still our best example of this genre. The transformation of New Zealand from bushlands to grasslands farming is anatomised in this close examination of the effects of plant and animal introductions on one piece of Hawke’s Bay.”Before his death in 1940 he revised and added to  Tutira. The revised edition was published in 1953.\n\nGuthrie-Smith died on 4 July 1940 at Tutira.

{"topic": "Glossopharyngeal breathing", "document": "Glossopharyngeal breathing (GPB, glossopharyngeal insufflation, buccal pumping, or frog breathing) is a means of pistoning air into the lungs to volumes greater than can be achieved by the person's breathing muscles (greater than maximum inspiratory capacity). The technique involves the use of the glottis to add to an inspiratory effort by gulping boluses of air into the lungs. It can be beneficial for individuals with weak inspiratory muscles and no ability to breathe normally on their own.\n\nThe technique was first observed by physicians in the late 1940s in polio patients at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital, in Los Angeles, by Dr. Clarence W. Dail and first described by Dail in 1951 in the journal California Medicine.\n\nBoth inspiratory and, indirectly, expiratory muscle function can be assisted by GPB. GPB can provide an individual with weak inspiratory muscles and no vital capacity or breathing ventilator-free breathing tolerance with normal alveolar ventilation and perfect safety when not using a ventilator or in the event of sudden ventilator failure day or night. The technique involves the use of the glottis to add to an inspiratory effort by projecting (gulping) boluses of air into the lungs. The glottis closes with each \"gulp\". One breath usually consists of 6 to 9 gulps of 40 to 200 ml each. During the training period the efficiency of GPB can be monitored by spirometrically measuring the milliliters of air per gulp, gulps per breath, and breaths per minute. A training manual and numerous videos are available, the most detailed of which was produced in 1999. For those who can not master GPB it is often because of inability of the soft palate to seal off the nose.\n\nAlthough severe oropharyngeal muscle weakness can limit the usefulness of GPB, researchers have cited Duchenne muscular dystrophy ventilator users who were very successful using it. Approximately 60% of ventilator users with no autonomous ability to breathe and good bulbar muscle function can use GPB for autonomous breathing from a span of minutes up to all day. Patients with no vital capacity have awoken from sleep using GPB to discover that their ventilators were no longer functioning. Some have spontaneously come out of anesthesia frog breathing and others out of grand mal convulsions surprisingly without being cyanotic.\n\nFootnotes\n\nMedical treatments", "instruction": " What is the success rate of Glossopharyngeal breathing in individuals with severe oropharyngeal muscle weakness?"}
{"topic": "20 Minute Loop", "document": "20 Minute Loop is a San Francisco-based band notable for its self-proclaimed \"freak-pop\" sound which exhibited hook-heavy tunes and complex vocal harmonies.\n\nThe band split up in 2009, but has since reformed.\n\nHistory \nIn its most rudimentary form, 20 Minute Loop was founded innominately by Giles during college, circa 1995, as a home-recording project. He recorded a handful of demos to 8-track tape, but never officially released them. He did, however, have the opportunity to play them live to small audiences acoustically several times, usually with the vocal accompaniment of Kelly Atkins, who would later be the only consistent member in 20 Minute Loop besides Giles.\n\nGiles originally toyed with other band names, such as With God on the Dog Team Trail, Pierre Bon Bon, Kill Whitey!, and PSA Flight 182, before finally settling on 20 Minute Loop. The band's name alluded to the duration of cockpit conversation recorded by an airplane's cockpit voice recorder for recovery in the event of a crash or other accident.\n\nThe actual band was established by Greg Giles in 1996, and their debut EP, With God On The Dog Team Trail, was released on New Year's Day in 1997. (Apart from Kelly Atkins, the band lineup Giles recruited for the EP featured no members of the final lineup.) With God On The Dog Team Trail featured a lo-fi rendition of \"Jubilation\"—which was rerecorded for Decline of Day—as well as three other songs that were never released in any other form. With God On The Dog Team Trail was released on a small indie label, Trystero Records, which was run by a friend of Giles and has since gone defunct.\n\nThe band soon parted with Trystero, and struggled along for a while with no means of releasing their music. They had recorded their first, self-titled album, and were already in the process of recording Decline of Day, when Jim Greer of the small, Berkeley-based indie label Fortune Records (not to be confused with the defunct Detroit, Michigan-based label of the same name) approached and offered to sign them. This begun a long-lasting relationship with Fortune Records—Greer would go on to release their first 3 albums and a split 7-inch with The Monolith.\n\nTheir debut album, 20 Minute Loop, was released to mostly positive critical reception, and thanks to positive publicity from local venues and indie distributor Aquarius Records, among others, they gained some recognition from the Bay Area indie scene. The band also played a great many shows in order to receive more publicity.\n\nWith a label deal and an album to their name, the band quickly released their second album, Decline of Day. This album received much more publicity, with positive reviews from Pitchfork, Allmusic, and CD Universe, et alia; yet the group still remained fairly unknown. The artwork for the album was provided by The Velvet Teen's lead singer Judah Nagler.\n\nThe band's breakthrough would arrive along with their next album, Yawn + House = Explosion, reviews for which appeared in nearly a dozen printed publications, as well as countless indie blogs. The artwork for Yawn + House = Explosion was of particular interest to many; the outside consisted of two different shots of a prepubescent girl grasping chickens, and the inside pamphlet consisted of the lyrics, many of which were determined using a dictionary game invented by the band, spelled out in such a way that it could be seen how certain words were strung together with the lyrics. This was the only album of 20 Minute Loop's to sell out; it sold a couple thousand copies.\n\nThe band parted from Fortune Records for unclear reasons to record their fourth album, Famous People Marry Famous People. The album, released in 2008, was arguably the band's most polished and intricate—it was recorded at John Vanderslice's renowned Tiny Telephone studio in San Francisco, and featured over a half-dozen extra performers. The album featured highly conceptual songs, with sophisticated underlying themes explained on each song's individual Bandcamp page. The album received slightly less publicity due to the loss of a label, but the band still did very well, receiving positive publicity from many well-known sites, such as PopMatters and KQED, amongst others.\n\nThe band played a few more shows before announcing a breakup on their Myspace, due to an inability to continue \"outmaneuvering real-life contingencies\". They announced that their \"final show ever\" would take place on November 15, but, untrue to their word, they reunited for Noise Pop 2012, opening for Imperial Teen.\n\nIn 2014, Greg Giles and Kelly Atkins reformed 20 Minute Loop with Kevin Seal of Griddle to unearth songs in a new stripped down format, including piano, guitar, viola and trumpet and focusing more on vocal harmonies and lyrical content. Jim Greer of Fortune Records was inspired to record this version of 20 Minute Loop. They released the album Songs Praising the Mutant Race in 2017, and have had numerous appearances since then, their most recent being in February 2023 at Great American Music Hall.\n\nMembers \nKelly Atkins – Vocals, Keyboards, Synthesizer, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Flute, Samples\nGreg Giles – Guitar, Vocals, Synthesizer\nNils Erickson – Bass, Guitar, Rhodes, Clavinet, Pedal Steel Guitar, Backing Vocals\nAdam Cunha – Bass, Backing Vocals\nMike Romano – Drums, Percussion, Piano, Backing Vocals\nKevin Seal – Piano, Rhodes, Vocals\n\nFormer members\nJoe Ostrowski – Guitar\nJames Kingsbury – Bass\nAlex Kamages – Drums\nDan Jones – Bass\nEthan Turner – Drums\nTai Kenning – Drums, Percussion\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums \n With God On The Dog Team Trail CD (Trystero, 1997)\n Jubilation\n Onion Smut\n Car Crash\n The Song You Hear Before You Die\n 20 Minute Loop CD (Fortune Records, 1999)\n She Hated Dogs\n Everybody Out\n Face Like A Horse\n Aeroflot\n Up On The Hill\n Disconnect\n You Know So Much\n Bunnyman and Chickengirl\n Hookworm\n All My Friends/Drowning\n Decline of Day CD (Fortune Records, 2001)\n Jubilation\n Moses\n All Manner\n Daughter's Down\n Pilot Light\n Force of Habit\n Mechanical Angels\n Elephant\n Mompha Termina\n Vaccine\n Hell In A Handbasket\n Aquarium Song/Kiddie Porn Sting\n Yawn + House = Explosion CD (Fortune Records, 2005)\n Parking Lot\n Cora May\n Properties Of Dirt\n Book of J\n Carlos the Jackal\n It's Time To Honor Ghouls\n Ambassadors\n 5 AM to 9 AM\n Our William Tell\n I'll Never Forget You\n Miriam Hopkins\n Famous People Marry Famous People CD (Self-Released, 2009)\n Vanilla March\n Dr. Vitus Werdegast\n English As A Second Language\n The Bone Is The Orbital Planet Of The Nerve\n Automatic Pilot\n Empire\n We Wait For The Crown\n Mercury Vapor\n Latin Names and Straight Pins\n ESMA\n The Kirkbridge Plan\n Winsor McCay\n Songs Praising the Mutant Race (Self-Released, 2017)\n Mercury Vapor\n English as a Second language\n Empire\n Giftgas\n Elephant\n Hell in a Handbasket\n Parking Lot\n Drowning\n Aquarium\n Carlos the Jackal\n Winsor McCay\n Never My Love\n\nCompilation appearances \n She Hated Dogs appears on Fortune Cookies (Fortune Records, 2000)\n Pilot Light appears on Azadi!

He led New Zealand to its first Test victories over India and Pakistan.\n\nHis finest moment came at Christchurch in 1967–68 when he made a nine-hour 239 that led to New Zealand's first victory against India. It was his first match as captain, and he was the only player to score a double century on his captaincy debut until the feat was equalled by Shivnarine Chanderpaul against South Africa in 2005. At the time, his 239 was the highest Test score for New Zealand. Nevertheless, New Zealand lost the two remaining Tests of the series to go down 1–3.\n\nDowling led New Zealand in 12 Tests in 1969, including three victories. They beat West Indies in Wellington in March, and shared the three-Test series 1–1. On a long nine-Test tour from June to November, they lost to England 0–2, shared the series with India 1–1, then beat Pakistan 1–0, New Zealand's first victory in a Test series.\n\nHe lost the middle finger of his left hand in 1970 after suffering an injury on the brief tour to Australia in 1969–70. On the tour to the West Indies in 1971–72 he suffered a back injury and had to return home after the Second Test. It was his last first-class match.\n\nAfter cricket\nDowling was a partner in an accounting firm, which enabled him to arrange his work around his absences playing cricket.\n\nDowling served as CEO of New Zealand Cricket. In the 1987 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket.

{"topic": "EGS-zs8-1", "document": "EGS-zs8-1 is a high-redshift Lyman-break galaxy found at the northern constellation of Boötes.  In May 2015, EGS-zs8-1 had the highest spectroscopic redshift of any known galaxy, meaning EGS-zs8-1 was the most distant and the oldest galaxy observed. In July 2015, EGS-zs8-1 was surpassed by EGSY8p7 (EGSY-2008532660).\n\nDescription\n\nThe redshift of EGS-zs8-1 was measured at z = 7.73, corresponding to a light travel distance of about 13.040 billion light years from Earth, and age of 13.04 billion years. The galaxy shows a high rate of star formation, so it releases its peak radiation at the vacuum ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum, near the  Lyman-alpha emission line due to the intense radiation from newly formed blue stars, hence it is classified as a Lyman-break galaxy; high-redshift starburst galaxies emitting the Lyman-alpha emission line. Because of the cosmological redshift effect caused by the expansion of the universe, the peak light from the galaxy has become redshifted and has moved into the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The galaxy has a comoving distance of about 30 billion light years from Earth.\n\nEGS-zs8-1 was born 670 million years after the Big Bang, during the period of reionization, and it's 15 percent the size of the Milky Way. The galaxy was found to be larger than its other neighbors in that period when the universe was still very young. Its mass at the time the light was emitted is estimated to have been about 15% of the Milky Way's current mass. The galaxy was making new stars at roughly 80 times the rate of the current Milky Way, or equivalent to 800  worth of material turning to stars every year. The light reaching Earth was made by stars in EGS-zs8-1 that were 100 million to 300 million years old at the time they emitted the light. The age of EGS-zs8-1 places it in the reionization phase of creation, a time when hydrogen outside the galaxies was switching from a neutral to ionized state. According to the galaxy's discoverers, EGS-zs8-1 and other early galaxies were likely the causes of reionization.\n\nDiscovery\nIn 2013, Yale astronomer Pascal Oesch spotted an unexpected bright object while looking at Hubble Space Telescope images. He then confirmed the existence of the object using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Redshift calculations, using the Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE) equipment at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, were then performed to precisely determine the age of the galaxy. Oesch and his colleagues at Yale and the University of California, Santa Cruz announced the find, which was named EGS-zs8-1, in May 2015 surpassing the previous record for oldest galaxy by about 30 million years.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nBoötes\nGalaxies\n?\nDwarf galaxies", "instruction": " What was the specific reason why EGS-zs8-1 was larger than its neighboring galaxies during the early stages of the universe?"}

He lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nBiography \n\nDuval was born in Paris, France, in 1977. His mother worked for the luxury goods manufacturer Hermès, while his father was an interior decorator. Duval studied for six years at the École nationale supérieure d'arts de Paris-Cergy, before moving to Tokyo in 2004.\n\nCareer \n\nDuval's work encompasses conceptual art, film, sculpture, product design, and visual communication. His alter ego Item Idem (Latin for \"the same\"), operates as a brand for the artist, whose work often builds on top of existing fashion and retail brands. The New York Times reviewed one of Duval's performances as \"Celine Dion at the Oscars channeling René Magritte,\" while the writer John Stones has described the artist's persona as \"Austin Powers pretending to be Philippe Starck, art directed by Marcel Duchamp and scripted by Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nRetail design and installations \n\nIn 2004, Duval was discovered by Sarah Andelman, the creative director of Colette. The Paris-based boutique teamed Duval up with the Japanese fashion label Comme des Garçons in Tokyo. His work began to incorporate interior design and conceptual installations. In 2004, Duval collaborated with other artists on a relational aesthetics-inspired, multidisciplinary space called Caniche Courage, and later transformed his three-story Shibuya residence into a living exhibition.\n\nDuval initiated a series of staged retail and working environments, beginning with The Wrong Store (2006) in Paris, a collaboration with Tobi Wong conceived as an ersatz gift-shop counterpart to Maurizio Cattelan's Wrong Gallery. Back in Tokyo, he transformed the window display of a fashion boutique into a temporary work space titled The Wrong Office, which he followed up with The Wrong Motel.\n\nDuval collaborated with Bernhard Willhelm on the German fashion designer's flagship store at the PARCO department store in Shibuya, Tokyo. The shop's re-use of cardboard, plastic, and rope materials was inspired by the resourcefulness of Japan's homeless communities.\nThe store won the Best Shop Concept for FRAME magazine's 2007 Great Indoors Award.\n\nIn 2009, Duval participated in the Cycles and Seasons fashion and art event in Moscow. In 2011, Duval was the first artist-in-residence at BLESS HOME, an apartment-cum-shop in Berlin, which became his temporary studio while serving as the art director for Bruce LaBruce's production of Pierrot Lunaire. In 2015, he built an installation as an interior for Airbnb's Art House for Art Basel Hong Kong.\n\nDuval has worked with a number of art publications, including as the Fashion Director for Tokion (2005), Fashion Features Director for Modern Weekly China (2013), Special Projects coordinator for Flash Art (2006),\nand as a collaborator with 032c, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and LEAP Magazine. He has also worked on large-scale commercial projects for CELINE and Ford.\n\nExhibitions and collaborations \n\nIn 2007, Duval reconfigured CELINE's Tokyo store to host his exhibition Displaysthetics during DesignTide Tokyo. In 2008, he participated in Fredric Snitzer Gallery's show in Miami, Death by Basel, with an oversized Chanel logo in the style of McDonald's Golden Arches, as a comparison of the brands and their markets. For AA Bronson's School for Young Shaman's exhibition in New York, Duval fashioned a cape out of Louis Vuitton bags and melted car tires, which was an homage to Joseph Beuys.\n\nFor the exhibition Dysfashional at the Garage Museum in Moscow in 2010, Duval created a work titled Mount Blushmore, a crystal engraving which combined images of fashion icons Anna Wintour, Donatella Versace, John Galliano and Karl Lagerfeld. In 2014, Duval mounted his first solo exhibition at Johannes Vogt, New York, titled Voir Dire.\n\nIn 2016, Duval participated in the Work in Progress artist residency in Times Square, New York. That same year, he held an exhibition titled Method of Loci at The Breeder Gallery in Athens, Greece, and collaborated with Flash Art Special Projects in a special presentation at Paramount Ranch.\n\nDuval has exhibited at the Centre Pompidou, the Garage Museum, MoMA PS1, and Palais de Tokyo. His work has been featured in 032c, Casa BRUTUS, FRAME, The New York Times, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Harper’s Bazaar Korea, and WWD.\n\nShanzhai Biennial \n\nDuval is the co-founder of the artists collective Shanzhai Biennial with stylist Avena Gallagher and artist Babak Radboy. The collective describes itself as a \"multinational brand posing as an art-project posing as an [sic] multinational brand posing as a biennial\", \"a pure brand unencumbered by products\", in other words a \"meta-brand\". The name is meant to evoke a bi-annual art exhibition, but instead of taking a city as its namesake, it refers to the Shanzhai counterfeit consumer goods industry in China, and the intentionally incorrect appropriation of luxury brand names. Inspired by knockoff goods in Manhattan's Chinatown, the collective was initiated as a critique of the art and fashion industries, as well as a celebration of the ingenuity and humour of Shanzhai culture. The collective undertakes projects by invitation from cultural institutions or brands, and highlights the aspect of Shanzhai that M+ curator Aric Chen has called the \"pop art of China\".\n\nAs a precursor to the collective's projects, Duval curated a selection of Shanzhai objects in collaboration with DIS Magazine. The objects were photographed by Marco Roso for an exhibition titled Shanzhai Anxiety at Colette in 2011.\n\nShanzhai Biennial No. 1 was held during Beijing Design Week 2012. The artists created a fake fashion campaign photo-shoot based on the paintings of Chinese artist Yue Minjun, and installed a false store-front in Beijing's Chaochangdi village, complete with red carpet, rope lines, and a step and repeat press wall. The ad campaign also ran as an eight-page editorial in the Chinese lifestyle magazine Modern Weekly. When the New York Times mistook the project for \"a high-concept fashion line\" that hadn't yet produced a collection, the artists decided not to issue a correction.\n\nShanzhai Biennial No. 2 consisted of a video depicting the artist Wu Ting Ting dressed as a shampoo bottle and lip-syncing to a Chinese rendition of Sinéad O'Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U, and was displayed on an LED curtain for MoMA PS1's ProBio exhibition in 2013.\n\nThe artists followed this up with Shanzhai Biennial No. 3 at Frieze London 2014, conceived as a branding exercise for the art fair. Working with a local luxury real-estate agency, the artists transformed a booth space into a model real-estate office ostensibly selling a £32 million London mansion, complete with a professional ad campaign, and trafficking in the Frieze brand with a fake luxury bag, and limited edition souvenirs.\n\nShanzhai Biennial has collaborated with the designer Telfar Clemens, the musician Fatima Al Qadiri, as well as TankTV and DIS Magazine, and has exhibited work at West Bund Art & Design, Centre Pompidou, and the New Museum.\n\nFilms \n\nIn 2013, Duval created the short film Joss with Chinese artist Cheng Ran, depicting paper funeral items resembling fashion accessories and commercial brands being destroyed by flames and fire crackers. The film has been screened at Palais de Tokyo (Paris), K11 Art Foundation Pop-up Space (Hong Kong), and Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei", "instruction": " What specific brands did Item Idem collaborate with in the context of his installations and retail designs?"}

It is a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe monastery is the largest in Italy. Its  building history covers 450 years, but the principal parts of the buildings are in Baroque style. It is a very large monastery, comprising 51,500 m2 (12.7 acres), with 320 rooms and halls.\n\nHistory\nPadula Charterhouse was founded by Tommaso di San Severino on 27 April 1306 on the site of an earlier monastery. It is dedicated to Saint Lawrence, and its architectural structure supposedly recalls the griddle-iron upon which the saint was burnt alive.\n\nThe monastery has the biggest cloister in the world, covering 12,000 m2 (2.97 acres) and surrounded by 84 columns. A famous spiral staircase of white marble inside an annex leads to the large library.\n\nAccording to the strict Carthusian distinction between contemplation and work, there are two distinct places for these practices: on the one hand the peaceful cloisters, the library with its fine Vietri ceramic tiled floor, the chapels decorated with fine inlaid marble works. The altar frontals in most of the chapels are inlaid, not with marble, but with some of the most spectacular 18th. century scagliola work ever created. This is the highest concentration of such work in one place. One of the centres of production was in Naples.  the cloister orchards; and on the other hand the large kitchen, the cellars with their enormous wine vats, the laundries, and the huge external yards, where there were people working in the stables, ovens, stores, and at the olive oil mill. The yards were used for productive activities and for trade between the charterhouse and the external world.\n\nThe monastery also houses the archaeological museum of Western Lucania, which preserves a collection of all the finds unearthed in the excavations at the necropolis of Sala Consilina and Padula. This museum represents a period of time ranging from protohistory to the Hellenistic Age.\n\nThe building has also played a role in the military history of Italy.   It served as French headquarters during the Napoleonic Wars, then as a base of Garibaldi's Southern Army during the Risorgimento, finally, as an internment camp for prisoners during the World War 1 and World War 2.

{"topic": "Water supply and sanitation in Vietnam", "document": "Water supply and sanitation in Vietnam is characterized by challenges and achievements. Among the achievements is a substantial increase in access to water supply and sanitation between 1990 and 2010, nearly universal metering, and increased investment in wastewater treatment since 2007.\n\nAmong the challenges are continued widespread water pollution, poor service quality, low access to improved sanitation in rural areas, poor sustainability of rural water systems, insufficient cost recovery for urban sanitation, and the declining availability of foreign grant and soft loan funding as the Vietnamese economy grows and donors shift to loan financing.\n\nThis has caused many Vietnamese to not fully trust water sources that may not be safe or clean, or even avoiding tap water and only using water that has been filtered and boiled. In Vietnam, it is not recommended to drink tap water directly. The Vietnamese government encourages to at least boil water before consumption, with many familiar with water filters but rural places often not being able to own one or lack access to them due to poverty or distance from more urban areas.\n\nThe government also promotes increased cost recovery through tariff revenues and has created autonomous water utilities at the provincial level, but the policy has had mixed success as tariff levels remain low and some utilities have engaged in activities outside their mandate.\n\nAccess\nIn 2015, 98% of the total population in Vietnam had access to \"improved\" water, or 99% and 97%, for the urban and rural population, respectively. That means that around 2 million people lacked access to \"improved\" water. Regarding sanitation, 78% of the population in Vietnam had access to \"improved\" sanitation, or 94% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population. Still, approximately 21 million people in Vietnam, in 2015, lacked accessed to \"improved\" sanitation.\n\nAccording to the UN's Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, access to an improved water source increased from 58% in 1990 to 96% in 2010. However, most Vietnamese receive water from a tap in the yard or a public tap in the village from where they have to carry water to their home. In 2010, only 23% of Vietnamese had a tap in their home. There are substantial differences in access between urban and \"rural\" areas. 70% of the Vietnamese population lives in rural areas, but many so-called rural areas are actually small towns, e.g. in the densely settled Red River Delta. In urban areas, 59% had a tap in their home, while in rural areas this share was only 8%. In 2009 over 200 out of approximately 650 district towns did not have any piped water system.\n\nAccess to improved sanitation increased from 37% in 1990 to 75% in 2011. There is a significant gap between urban areas, where access stands at 93%, and rural areas with an access of only 67%. In 2009, 75% of households in provincial towns were not connected to a sewer. Septic tanks are common, but with the exception of Hai Phong, no town offers a reasonable desludging service.\n\nWater resources\nVietnam has abundant surface and ground water resources. Nevertheless, local shortages can occur during the dry season. For example, the basins of the Dong Nai River in South Vietnam, the Southeast River Cluster, Ma River in North Central Vietnam, Kone River and Huong River are expected to be at risk of exceeding projected water needs in 2020.\n\nThe 7 million people in Ho Chi Minh City receive 93% of their drinking water from two treatment plants on the Dong Nai River and the much smaller Sai Gon River, with the remaining 7% coming from overexploited groundwater that is polluted by seawater intrusion and contamination. Dong Nai River, which is regulated further upstream by two dams, has ample water resources to supply the growing city with more water. However, in dry years drinking water supply competes with agricultural uses that may together exceed water availability.\n\nHanoi with its more than 6 million inhabitants receives 80% of its water from groundwater. Groundwater is polluted by ammonium with a concentration that is 5 to 10 times (7–20 mg/L) higher than the allowed standard. Surface water comes from the Gia Lam plant completed in 1994  and the Thang Long North-Van Tri plant completed in 2004, both financed by Japanese development assistance. It is planned that surface water from the Da River, the Red River and the Duong River will satisfy the growing water demand in the future and gradually replace the existing ground water. During the dry season in 2013 several districts of Hanoi went completely without water. A transmission pipeline from the existing plant on the Da River suffered numerous breaks, exacerbating water scarcity. The Vietnamese company Vinaconex built the pipeline with fibreglass-reinforced pipes that it manufactured itself using. With anti-Chinese sentiment riding high in Vietnam, the faults have been blamed on the perceived low-cost Chinese technology behind the manufacturing process. When a Chinese firm won a contract to build\na second pipeline in 2016, the government cancelled the contract.\n\nService quality\n\nDrinking water quality\nIn early 2009 tests by the Vietnam Institute of Biotechnology showed widespread contamination of municipal tap water, including high levels of e-coli. Most residents boil drinking water, because they do not trust the quality of the tap water, or use bottled water. Some tap water samples were also contaminated with ammonia at levels that were 6–18 times higher than the allowed level. Ammonia in drinking water is not a direct health risk, but it can compromise disinfection efficiency, cause the failure of some filters, and it causes taste and odor problems. Arsenic levels were two to three times higher than acceptable according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Bacteria were also found in bottled water samples, according to analyses by the Ho Chi Minh City health department in 2009, leading to 38 water bottling firms being ordered closed.\n\nPollution and wastewater treatment\n\nWater pollution is a serious issue in Vietnam as a result of rapid industrialization and urbanization without adequate environmental management. As of 2008 only 10 percent of municipal wastewater was treated, and only 45% of industrial zones were expected to have wastewater treatment of some kind in 2010. The pollution of rivers and lakes in Hanoi is \"alarming\" according to municipal authorities, as up to 98 per cent of 200 rivers and lakes fail to meet the required water quality. Sewer systems consist of combined sewers, channeling both rainwater and municipal sewage. Small enterprises engaged in food processing and textile dyeing in so-called \"craft villages\", of which there are 700 in the Red River Delta alone, discharge untreated wastewater. An analysis by the University of Technologies and the Ministry of Science and Technology showed that 100% of wastewater samples taken from craft villages exceed allowed levels of pollution. Vietnam also has more than 200 registered industrial zones without sustainable wastewater treatment. Industrial zones discharge 1 million cubic meters of untreated sewage per day, about 70 percent of all industrial wastewater. 8 industrial zones will be equipped with wastewater treatment plants with the help of a US$50 million loan from the World Bank approved in 2012. It is also planned to construct 30 wastewater treatment plants in the Mekong Delta until 2020, including 13 plants for domestic wastewater treatment and 17 for industrial wastewater treatment in Can Tho, a Giang, Kien Giang and Ca Mau provinces. In 2012 Hanoi expected to start the operation of the upgraded Yen So waste water treatment plant with a design capacity of 200,000 cubic meters per day; eight more wastewater treatment plants are planned in Hanoi alone.\n\nResponsibility for water supply and sanitation\n\nResponsibility for policy setting\nWithin the national government responsibility for water supply and sanitation is shared between three Ministries. Urban water supply and sewerage is under the Ministry of Construction. Rural water supply is under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, while rural sanitation and hygiene are under the Ministry of Health. The structure of Ministries is mirrored at the provincial level, where each Ministry has branches. The 58 provinces have considerable autonomy in implementing policies.

{"topic": "Have Quick", "document": "[[File:Arc-164-rt.jpg|thumb|200px|UHF-Aircraft station AN/ARC-164 HAVE QUICK II]]\n\nHAVE QUICK (also HAVEQUICK, short HQ) is an ECM-resistant frequency-hopping system used to protect military aeronautical mobile (OR) radio traffic.\n\nSince the end of World War II, U.S. and Allied military aircraft have used AM radios in the NATO harmonised  225–400 MHz UHF band (part of NATO B band) for short range air-to-air and ground-to-air communications. During development and the procurement of UHF radios, military planners did not require features to secure communications for aircraft and helicopters from jamming until the post-Vietnam War era. Progress in electronics in the 1970s reached a point where anyone with an inexpensive radio frequency scanner or receiver set could intercept military communications. Once the target frequencies were identified, radio frequency jamming could easily be employed to degrade or completely disable communications.\n\nThe HAVE QUICK program was a response to this problem. Engineers recognized that newer aircraft radios already included all-channel frequency synthesizers along with keyboards and displays for data entry. The only other system requirements to achieve the desired anti-jam functionality were an accurate clock (for timed synchronization) and a microprocessor to add frequency hopping to existing radios.\n\nAircraft and ground radios that employ HAVE QUICK must be initialized with accurate time of day (TOD; usually from a GPS receiver), a word of the day (WOD), and a net identifier (providing mode selection and multiple networks to use the same word of the day). A word of the day is a transmission security variable that consists of six segments of six digits each. The word of the day is loaded into the radio or its control unit to key the HAVE QUICK system to the proper hopping pattern, rate, and dwell time. The word of the day, time of day and net identifier are input to a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator that controls the frequency changes.\n\nHAVE QUICK is not an encryption system, though many HAVE QUICK radios can be used with encryption; e.g. the KY-58 VINSON system. HAVE QUICK is not compatible with SINCGARS, the VHF - FM radios used by ground forces, which operate in a different radio band and use a different frequency hopping method; however some newer radios support both.\n\n Particularities \n A national Air Force operates generally in a closed common user group. However, deviation to this regulation existed on German territory until 1990. E.g. the HQ-user of the German Air Force in the North of Germany, operational subordinated to 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force used HQ net-group 1, whereas the southern units, subordinated to 4th Allied Tactical Air Force, used HQ net-group 2.\n The co-ordination of HQ radio frequency channels in the NATO-harmonised UHF-band, the design of the so-called HQ hop-sets, is provided in NATO-Europe in responsibility of the NATO Allied Radio Frequency Agency (ARFA) in Brussels.\n For training and exercises, HQ operates in peacetime mode with limited frequency access. Four net-numbers may be used overlapping in net-group 1 and 2. However, in tactical operation mode this limitation might be lifted.\n Some HQ-features are compatible to encryption hardware; e.g. to the KY-58 VINSON-family.\n\n Utilization in the US and NATO \nHAVE QUICK was well adopted, and as of 2007 is used on nearly all U.S. military and NATO aircraft. Improvements include HAVE QUICK II Phase 2, and a \"Second generation Anti-Jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO\" called SATURN''. The latter features more complex frequency hopping.\n\nSee also\nAN/PRC-152\n AN/ARC-164\n AN/PRC-117F\n AN/ARC-182\n AN/ARC-210\n B band (NATO)\n Combat-net radio\n Spread spectrum\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n AN/ARC-164 HAVE QUICK II\n Software Enables Radio Family Ties\n Airscene HAVE QUICK II\n \n\nMilitary radio systems\nMilitary radio systems of the United States\nMilitary electronics of the United States", "instruction": " What is the specific frequency hopping pattern used by HAVE QUICK and how does it differ from other frequency hopping methods?"}

Nightclub singer Pinkie Leroy falls in love with a sailor.  Pinkie and her lover get mixed up with gangsters, a lost package and a missing diamond necklace. In the end, the police arrest the perpetrators, and Pinkie gets her man.\n\nThe musical premiered at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, on 16 May 1950, followed by more tryouts at the Liverpool Empire Theatre and the Birmingham Alhambra Theatre. It transferred to the Cambridge Theatre, London, on 7 July 1950, where it ran for 211 performances until 6 January 1951. The cast included Pat Kirkwood, Sylvia Cecil, Graham Payn, Jean Carson and Myles Eason. Mantovani was the musical director. Stage and costume designs were by Gladys Calthrop.\n\nDespite its modest run, Ace of Clubs contained several songs that survived independently, in Coward's later cabaret acts and elsewhere, including \"Sail Away\" and \"I Like America\".

His 1945 revue Sigh No More ran for only 213 performances in the West End, and the failure of his musical Pacific 1860 in 1946–47 was in contrast to the success of the show that followed it at Drury Lane, Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!, which ran for more than ten times as long.

Felix, the compère, introduces the club's girls, who perform their opening number.  Benny plans the pickup of a parcel with a gangster, Smiling Snyder.  The parcel is in the cloakroom wrapped in a raincoat.  When Snyder forcibly steals a kiss from Pinkie Leroy, the club's star, in the middle of her act, a sailor named Harry punches Snyder, who draws his gun and fires.  Pinkie takes the raincoat to cover her skimpy costume and escapes with Harry.\n\nHarry and Pinkie discover the parcel in the raincoat, but it falls out and Harry finds it after Pinkie goes back to the club.  Benny is already looking for the missing parcel, and Rita, who is in love with him, realises that Benny is involved with the gangsters.  At rehearsal the next afternoon, Harry comes by to see Pinkie. Detective-lnspector Warrilove arrives to investigate a jewel robbery and shooting.  He suspects Snyder.  Benny discourages Pinkie from becoming involved with Harry.  That evening Snyder and his associate, Guy, kidnap Harry during the show, but he escapes.  Pinkie, afraid for Harry's safety, promises Benny that she will get the parcel.  Harry is hidden, and after Benny leaves, he and Pinkie meet.\n\nThe next day, Harry return with the parcel, suggesting that they give it to the police.  Pinkie disagrees, and they argue.  That evening, one of the girls mistakes the parcel for her birthday present and opens it, finding the purloined necklace.  Snyder and Gus pick up the parcel in exchange for cash.  Rita hears that the stolen necklace has been traced to the club.  She asks the gangsters to leave.  In the club, Warrilove notices the necklace, which the birthday girl is wearing, and he follows her.  Snyder and Gus open the parcel to find the birthday present, a pair of falsies.  They return to the club, and Warrilove catches them.  All ends happily for Benny and Rita as well as Pinkie and Harry.\n\nMusical numbers\n\nAct 1\n \"Top of the Morning\" – Baby and Ace of Clubs Girls\n \"My Kind of Man\" – Pinkie\n \"This Could be True\" – Pinkie and Harry\n \"Nothing Can Last For Ever\" – Rita\n \"Something About a Sailor\" – Harry\n \"I'd Never, Never Know\" – Pinkie\n \"Three Juvenile Delinquents\" – Juvenile Delinquents\n \"Sail Away\" – Harry\n \"Josephine\" – Pinkie\n Reprise: \"My Kind of Man\" – Pinkie\n \"Would You Like to Stick a Pin in my Balloon?\" – Ace of Clubs Girls\n\nAct 2\n \"In a Boat on a Lake with My Darling\" – Sextet\n \"I Like America\" – Harry and Ace of Clubs Girls\n \"Why Does Love Get in the Way?\" – Pinkie \n \"Three Juvenile Delinquents\" Juvenile Delinquents \n \"Evening in Summer\" – Rita\n Reprise: \"Sail Away\" – Harry\n *Time for Baby's Bottle\" – Baby, Yvonne, Mavis\n \"Chase Me, Charlie\" – Pinkie\n Reprise: \"Nothing Can Last For Ever\" – Rita\n Reprise: \"My Kind of Man\" – Pinkie\n\nSource: Theatrical Companion to Coward.\n\nCritical reaction\nThe Times thought that Coward had striven too hard for popular success with his score: \"In spite of the mixed reception it is possible that Ace of Clubs, for all its crudity and its slightly old-fashioned air, will give a great many people what they consider lively entertainment.

{"topic": "Typhoon Mike", "document": "Typhoon Mike, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ruping, of 1990 was the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines since Typhoon Irma in 1981 and Typhoon Nina in 1987. Forming from an area of persistent convection over the Caroline Islands, Mike was first designated on November 6, 1990 and moved generally westward. Later that day, the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Mike near Yap. Mike became a typhoon early on November 9, and subsequently entered a period of rapid deepening. Late on November 10, the typhoon reached its maximum intensity of , as estimated by the Japanese Meteorological Agency. After weakening slightly, Mike made landfall in the central Philippines. The storm weakened considerably due to land interaction, only to briefly re-intensify on November 14. Typhoon Mike turned west-northwest and later north-northwest, avoiding land interaction with Vietnam. Vertical wind shear increased, and on November 15, Mike weakened below typhoon intensity. Early the next day, the storm passed over western Hainan Island, and degraded to a tropical depression that night. After briefly emerging into the Gulf of Tonkin, Mike passed over Northern Vietnam and southern China, where it dissipated on November 18.\n\nDuring its formative stages, Mike passed just north of Palau. There, one person was hurt and around 90% of the banana and coconut crops were leveled. A total of 1,035 houses and 10 businesses were damaged. Damage on the island totaled $2 million, including $1.3 million in property damage. After striking the Philippines, the typhoon brought widespread damage and was considered the worst typhoon to hit the country since Typhoon Ike in 1984. In Cebu City, 88 ships sunk, the most ships ever sunk at the Cebu City harbor during a tropical cyclone. Power and phone lines were downed and the city lost access to drinking water for two days. Approximately 60% of all buildings were demolished and 28 people perished in the city. Nationwide, 748 people were killed while 1,274 others suffered injuries. A total of 1,900,000 t (2,094,390 short tons) of sugar crops were destroyed. A total of 630,885 homes were damaged and 222,026 houses were demolished, resulting in 1,110,020 people displaced. Offshore, 159 vessels sunk and 28 others were washed aground and damaged. Monetary damage was estimated at $446 million (₱10.8 billion), including $46.1 million (₱1.12 billion) from crops, $350 million (₱8.52 billion) from public infrastructure, and $49.9 million (₱1.21 billion) from private infrastructure. At the time, Mike was the costliest tropical cyclone listed in the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council's database, and as of 2014, is the seventh costliest typhoon to strike the country since independence in 1947. Elsewhere, 68 people were killed in Vietnam, but no damage was reported in China.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nTyphoon Mike originated from a persistent area of convection that was first monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on November 6. At midday, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit. At 15:03 UTC on November 6, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, after a rapid improvement in the system's convective structure and Dvorak estimates of T1.0/. Following an increase in the storm's convection and an expansion of its outflow, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on November 7. Several hours later, the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm. At 00:00 UTC on November 8, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Mike.\n\nAfter becoming a tropical storm, Mike tracked west-northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge. The JTWC initially forecast Mike to track northwest over the Philippine Sea. Later in the morning hours of November 8, the JMA classified Mike as a severe tropical storm. Shortly thereafter, Mike entered a period of rapid deepening, aided by two dual outflow channels and a trough to the northeast. Due to the formation of an eye, the JTWC declared Mike a typhoon at 00:00 UTC on November 9, with the JMA following suit six hours later. Midday on November 10, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T7.0/ and satellite imagery indicated a  diameter eye and good upper-level outflow. Based on this, the JTWC raised the intensity of Mike to , making Mike a super typhoon. At 18:00 UTC, the JTWC increased the winds to , marking a  increase in wind speed, or a barometric pressure drop of  in a two-day time period. Early on November 11, the JMA estimated that Mike attained its peak intensity, with winds of  and a minimum pressure of .\n\nAfter turning west-northwest in the general direction of the central Philippines, Mike leveled off in intensity. Land interaction took toll on the typhoon on November 12 as cloud top temperatures surrounding the eye warmed and the eye became increasingly cloud-filled, coinciding with a weakening trend. Later that day, the typhoon made landfall on the Cebu province, with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of  respectively. The system maintained typhoon intensity over the island chain. After Mike entered the South China Sea, the JTWC and many tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that the typhoon would strike into Vietnam, but this did not occur. Slight re-strengthening occurred over the open waters in the South China Sea. On November 14, the JMA reported that Mike reached a secondary peak intensity of  while the JTWC estimated a secondary maximum intensity of . The next day, Typhoon Mike turned north-northwest in response to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Increased vertical wind shear induced a weakening trend, and midday on November 15, the JMA downgraded Mike to a severe tropical storm. Twenty-four hours later, the JTWC downgraded Mike to a tropical storm as its structure became less organized. Later on November 16, Mike passed over the western portion of Hainan Island, and after briefly tracking through the Gulf of Tonkin, Mike moved inland over Quảng Ninh, Vietnam as a tropical depression. Overland, Mike rapidly dissipated; both the JTWC and the JMA ended tracking the system on November 18.\n\nPreparations\nMaximum storm alerts were raised across the central Philippines, with lower warnings issued for the southern tip of Luzon. Authorities advised coastal residents to move to higher ground in Samar, and Leyte islands, as well as the northern region of Mindanao. The Philippine Airlines cancelled 59 domestic flights from Manila and Cebu, but international flights were unaffected. Schools were called off in northern Mindanao and domestic shipping services were temporarily cancelled.\n\nImpact\n\nCaroline Islands\nDuring its formative stages, Mike caused minor damage in Yap. The storm passed  north of Koror, the capital of Palau. The local National Weather Service office recorded winds of ,  of rain, and a minimum sea level pressure of . Power, water and telephone services were knocked out and streets were blocked by fallen trees. Many roofs were lost and extensive damage occurred to boats, greenhouses, agriculture projects, fruit trees and vegetable gardens. The heaviest damage occurred in the states of Ngaraard,  Ngarchelong, and Kayangel. In Ngaraard, 50% of houses were destroyed and the other 50% were damaged. Across the state of Kayangel, situated just to the north of the island of Babelthuap, most trees were uprooted and a majority of residents lost everything. Nationwide, around 90% of the banana and coconut crops were leveled. In all, one person was wounded but no fatalities were reported, but the area the storm struck was sparsely populated.

{"topic": "Emile Doo's Chemist Shop", "document": "Emile Doo's Chemist Shop is an exhibition at the Black Country Living Museum in England. It was originally situated at 358 Halesowen Road, Netherton, before being rebuilt on the museum site.\n\nHistory\nBefore the National Health Service was formed, local chemist shops like Doo's played an important part in the health of the local community. They offered services such as free medical advice, basic First Aid and weekly weighing of babies.\n\nDoo's was originally built in 1886 as a tailor's shop. James Emile Doo traded from 1882 in a building across the road from 358, the business being taken over by his newly qualified son Harold Emile Doo, in about 1918. In 1929 Harold moved trading to their new premises at 358. The move was so carefully planned that dispensing was carried out until 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night in the old premises, and then started trading in the new premises the next morning at 9:00 a.m. Harold traded as a chemist until ill health forced his retirement in May 1968.\n\nExhibition\n\nThe shop lay untouched from 1968 to 1973, when the fittings and stock were donated to The Black Country Living Museum. The shop now located in The Black Country Living Museum is built using bricks reclaimed from two houses which were demolished in Pearson Street, Old Hill. The original shop front was also rescued and forms part of the exhibit today. The shop exhibition is much tidier than the shop would have been in real life. It would have been cluttered with hampers full of deliveries often leaving little room for customers.\n\nWith guidance from Emile Doo's daughter Betty, the shop has been laid out as it was shortly after the move across the road in 1929.\n\nItems on display\n\nWafer machine\nThis was used for making thin soluble wafers for customers who needed medication dissolved in water. The prescribed ingredients were mixed to a paste with a binding agent and milk sugar. The mixture was then smeared over the top plate, which was flipped up so the wafers would slide into the bottom tray and could be dispensed via the extended section at the corner.\n\nPaper folder\nBefore pills and tablets became widespread, prescribed medicine was mainly dispensed in the form of powders.\n\nThe practice continued in this century for things such as headache powders and infant teething powders. The ingredients were mixed together in a mortar and then individually wrapped in separate doses. The paper squares in which the powders were folded all had to be folded to the same dimensions so that they would fit neatly together into a box for the customer. The width of the paper could be adjusted using the ratchet mechanism on the side. The dose of powder was placed in the middle of a rectangular piece of white demi paper. The two edges were folded over to the width of the box, and then the paper strip was pressed over the folder to form two sharp creases. The two ends were brought together and one end pushed into the other forming a secure package. The folded doses were then put in a box or tied together to form a neat bundle.\n\nSuppository mould\nThe ingredients for the suppositories were melted into a base of cocoa butter or glycerine, and the mixture was brought to the boil and poured into the moulds.  When the preparation was set (after about 30 minutes in cool weather) the two halves were unscrewed to release the suppositories.\n\nEmile Doo\nKnown locally as Jack, he was a well-known figure in Netherton, both through his work at The Chemist, and also for his involvement in amateur theatricals. He was a member of The 'Blue and Whites', a Pierrot troupe and did make up for other groups.\n\nIn the main, his life was dominated by the shop which was a focal point for local residents who needed minor treatment but could not afford doctors' fees. He had a considerable reputation for his own remedies. People came from far and wide to visit the shop. If you lived too far away to visit the shop, you could have your medicine delivered by post. He kept a book with all his remedies listed in, which his daughter still keeps today.\n\nHe qualified as a pharmacist in 1908. When he took the exam there were 133 candidates. 95 failed, with only 38 candidates achieving a pass. His certificate, and his father's, are on display.\n\nMr Doo suffered badly from arthritis, so could not move around easily. This may help explain why there was so much untouched stock in the cellar of the shop.\n\nLocals who remember him, described him as a white haired gentleman who whistled constantly through his teeth as he worked in the shop.\n\nHis dog Pip was a character too. The dog would come along to visit him during opening hours, having travelled alone by tram from Kinver to reach the shop.\n\nReferences\n\nBlack Country Living Museum\nRelocated buildings and structures in the United Kingdom", "instruction": " What specific remedies did Emile Doo become renowned for among the local community?"}

{"topic": "The Public Eye (film)", "document": "The Public Eye is a 1992 American crime thriller film produced by Sue Baden-Powell and written and directed by Howard Franklin, starring Joe Pesci and Barbara Hershey. Stanley Tucci and Richard Schiff appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely based on New York Daily News photographer Arthur \"Weegee\" Fellig, and some of the photos in the film were taken by Fellig.\n\nPlot\nIn the 1940s, Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein is a freelance crime and street photographer for the New York City tabloids, dedicated to his vivid and realistic work and his unique ability to capture shots that nobody else can. He is very confident of his skills, declaring at one point, \"Nobody does what I do. Nobody\".\n\nWith a police radio under the dashboard of his car and a makeshift darkroom in his trunk, he quickly races to the scene of horrific crimes and accidents in order to snap exclusive photographs. He is so good at his job that he becomes known affectionately as the \"Great Bernzini\".\n\nBernzy meets a sultry widow, Kay Levitz, who owns a fancy nightclub. It seems the mob is muscling in on her due to some arrangement with her late husband. Kay asks if Bernzy could investigate an individual she considers troublesome. Generally unsuccessful with women, Bernzy agrees to help Kay, and he slowly begins to fall in love with her.\n\nAfter talking to his contacts, including journalist friend Arthur Nabler, he tracks down Kay's man, only to find him murdered. But when he calls the police, he becomes a suspect in the man's death. The police and the FBI are also very interested in this case. Bernstein makes a connection with a local gangster, Sal, uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war about illegal gas rationing, and the Federal government. His activities get Sal killed and place Bernzy's life in great danger as he waits in hiding at an Italian restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place.\n\nCast\n Joe Pesci as Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein\n Barbara Hershey as Kay Levitz\n Stanley Tucci as Sal\n Jerry Adler as Arthur Nabler\n Dominic Chianese as Spoleto\n Richard Riehle as Officer O'Brien\n Max Brooks as Teen At Thompson Street\n Richard Schiff as Thompson Street Photographer\n Christian Stolte as Ambulance Attendant\n Jack Denbo as Photo Editor\n Timothy Hendrickson as Richard Rineman\n Del Close as H.R. Rineman\n Lisa Christakis as Young Bride With Soldier Husband\n\nProduction\nJoe Pesci took this role right after his Oscar-winning performance in Goodfellas.  It was an attempt to capitalize on his popularity at the time and help elevate Pesci from respected character actor to star status.\n\nDirector and writer Howard Franklin was unable to secure the rights to Arthur \"Weegee\" Fellig's story.  Franklin, then, wrote the story of a Weegee-like photographer who smokes cigars and he named him Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein.  In the film, like Weegee, cops wonder if Bernzy uses a ouija board to snap his photographs and find the stories.\n\nAccording to journalist Doug Trapp, Franklin was inspired to write the screenplay after seeing a show of Fellig's photos in the 1980s at the International Center of Photography in New York City. And Weegee did, in real life, have  a \"soul-mate\" named Wilma Wilcox, who was the woman in charge of his estate.  But, Franklin has always denied that the film was about their relationship.\n\nAs the film is loosely modelled on Weegee, but the story is not, several photographers' pictures, along with some by Weegee, stand in for his work, including those of Lisette Model, Mickey Pallas, Wilbert H. Blanche, Irving Haberman, Ray Platnick, Roger Smith and Charles Steinheimer. Director Franklin says he was looking for \"edgy, modern, high-contrast 40's\" lighting and compositions with the “stark, rather lurid effects of flash, which pick out the central subject while everything around falls off rapidly into darkness”\n\nFilming\nThe Public Eye began filming on July 24, 1991 and completed October 28, 1991.\n\nEven though the film takes place in Manhattan, it was shot in Chicago, Illinois, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California.\n\nRelease\nThe producers used the following tagline when marketing the film:\nMurder. Scandal. Crime. No matter what he was shooting, \"The Great Bernzini\" never took sides he only took pictures ...

The film also was shown at the Venice Film Festival and the Valladolid International Film Festival in Spain.\n\nIt opened on October 14, 1992 in New York City and Los Angeles and expanded to 635 theatres two days later.\n\nThe film's box office performance was a disappointment. The film grossed $1,139,825 for the weekend and the total receipts after 12 days were $3,067,917.\n\nHome media\nThe film was released in video format on April 14, 1993 and in LaserDisc on April 21, 1993.\n\nIn September 2007 an Unbox Digital Video Download was made available. The movie is also available at Amazon.com as digital Video on Demand.\n\nIt was released on DVD on January 31, 2011 in the Universal Vault Series. It was released on Blu-ray from Kino Lorber on July 28, 2020.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\nChicago Sun-Times film critic, Roger Ebert, was especially complimentary of the film and of actor Joe Pesci, and wrote, \"One of the best things about the movie is the way it shows us how seriously Bernzy takes his work. He doesn't talk about it. He does it, with that cigar stuck in his mug, leading the way with the big, ungainly Speed Graphic with the glass flashbulbs. In the movie's big scene of a mob assassination, he stares death in the face to get a great picture.\" Ebert said the film made him \"think\" a little bit of Casablanca (1942).\n\nTime Out magazine liked the acting and the script, and wrote, \"The main virtue of screenwriter Franklin's debut as director is Pesci's portrayal of Weegee, the famous low-life tabloid photographer of urban disaster, lightly concealed as Bernstein, 'The Great Bernzini'... good dialogue, nice period recreation, great performances.\"\n\nDesson Howe, film critic for The Washington Post wrote, \"Public wants to be taken for an atmospheric film noir, full of intrigue, romance and street toughness. But it's all flash and no picture. Despite the usual quippy, perky performance from Pesci, as well as cinematographer Peter Suschitzky's moodily delineated images, the movie is superficial and unengaging. It's as if Life magazine decided to make an oldtime gangster movie.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nThe original score for the film was written and recorded by Jerry Goldsmith, but he was replaced by Mark Isham at a late stage. As such, Isham had a lot of work to do and in a short time.  He later noted that he found working with director Franklin a wonderful and educational experience.\n\nA motion picture original soundtrack was released on October 13, 1992 under the Varèse Sarabande label.  The CD contained nineteen tracks in total, with one by Shorty Rogers.  Mark Isham crafts a dark melody focusing on piano, string, and trumpet parts, while mixing in symphonic, jazz, and electronic music.\n\nWhile originally thought lost or incomplete, Jerry Goldsmith's original score was later released by Intrada Records in 2021. Goldsmith's score features 22 tracks and a run time of just over 40 minutes, proving its completion prior to the change.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n \n The Public Eye shooting screenplay draft for educational purposes\n \n\n1992 films\n1992 crime thriller films\n1990s American films\n1990s English-language films\nAmerican crime thriller films\nAmerican neo-no", "instruction": " What were the reasons behind Jerry Goldsmith being replaced by Mark Isham as the composer for The Public Eye's soundtrack?"}

In 2008, he was inducted to the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame.\n\nWillemse started his career as a freestyle swimmer, winning 13 national titles and setting 19 national records in the 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m events between 1952 and 1958. In 1959, he switched to marathon swimming and became the second Dutchman to cross the English Channel, with a time of 12h49. Later in the 1960s he dominated the world marathon swimming. For three years after 1964, when the point system was introduced, he was ranked world number two, after Abo Heif. His clean sweep of the Around-the-Island Marathon Swim in 1960–1964 brought the organizers to a problem that spectators lost interest in the race. The race was discontinued in 1965.\n\nA school teacher by profession, Willemse was known for his academic approach to swimming. He would often travel around the place before the competition and measure the water temperature, to optimize his racing strategy, or even withdraw from a potentially disastrous race if the temperature was too low.

{"topic": "Ablative case", "document": "In grammar, the ablative case (pronounced ; sometimes abbreviated ) is a grammatical case for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives in the grammars of various languages; it is sometimes used to express motion away from something, among other uses. The word \"ablative\" derives from the Latin , the (irregular) perfect, passive participle of auferre \"to carry away\".\n\nThe ablative case is found in several language families, such as Indo-European (e.g., Sanskrit, Latin, Albanian, Armenian), Turkic (e.g., Turkish, Turkmen, Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tatar), Tungusic (e.g., Manchu, Evenki), Uralic (e.g., Hungarian), and the Dravidian languages. There is no ablative case in modern Germanic languages such as German and English. There was an ablative case in the early stages of Ancient Greek, but it quickly fell into disuse by the classical period.\n\nIndo-European languages\n\nLatin\n\nThe ablative case in Latin (cāsus ablātīvus) appears in various grammatical constructions, including following various prepositions, in an ablative absolute clause, and adverbially. The Latin ablative case was derived from three Proto-Indo-European cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at).\n\nGreek\nIn Ancient Greek, there was an ablative case ( ) which was used in the Homeric, pre-Mycenaean, and Mycenean periods. It fell into disuse during the classical period and thereafter with some of its functions taken by the genitive and others by the dative. The genitive case with the prepositions   \"away from\" and   \"out of\" is an example.\n\nGerman\nGerman does not have an ablative case but, exceptionally, Latin ablative case-forms were used from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century after some prepositions, for example after von in von dem Nomine: ablative of the Latin loanword Nomen. Grammarians at that time, Justus Georg Schottel, Kaspar von Stieler (\"der Spate\"), Johann Balthasar von Antesperg and Johann Christoph Gottsched, listed an ablative case (as the sixth case after nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and vocative) for German words. They arbitrarily considered the dative case after some prepositions to be an ablative, as in  (\"from the man\" or \"of the man\") and  (\"with the man\"), while they considered the dative case after other prepositions or without a preposition, as in , to be a dative.\n\nAlbanian\nThe ablative case is found in Albanian; it is the fifth case, rasa rrjedhore.\n\nSanskrit\nIn Sanskrit, the ablative case is the fifth case (pañcamī) and has a similar function to that in Latin. Sanskrit nouns in the ablative often refer to a subject \"out of\" which or \"from\" whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred: pátram taróḥ pátati \"the leaf falls from the tree\". It is also used for nouns in several other senses, as for actions occurring \"because of\" or \"without\" a certain noun, indicating distance or direction. When it appears with a comparative adjective, (śreṣṭhatamam, \"the best\"), the ablative is used to refer to what the adjective is comparing: \"better than X\".\n\nArmenian\nThe modern Armenian ablative has different markers for each main dialect, both originating from Classical Armenian. The Western Armenian affix -է -ē (definite -էն -ēn) derives from the classical singular; the Eastern Armenian affix -ից -ic’ (both indefinite and definite) derives from the classical plural. For both dialects, those affixes are singular, with the corresponding plurals being -(ն)երէ(ն)  and -(ն)երից .\n\nThe ablative case has several uses. Its principal function is to show \"motion away\" from a location, point in space or time:\n\nIt also shows the agent when it is used with the passive voice of the verb:\n\nIt is also used for comparative statements in colloquial Armenian (including infinitives and participles):\n\nFinally, it governs certain postpositions:\n\nUralic languages\n\nFinnish\nIn Finnish, the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning \"from, off, of\": pöytä – pöydältä \"table – off from the table\". It is an outer locative case, used like the adessive and allative cases, to denote both being on top of something and \"being around the place\" (as opposed to the inner locative case, the elative, which means \"from out of\" or \"from the inside of\"). With the locative, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.\n\nThe Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate times of something happening (kymmeneltä \"at ten\") as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.\n\nThe Finnish ablative has the ending -lta or -ltä, depending on vowel harmony.\n\nUsage\n away from a place\n\nkatolta: off the roof\npöydältä: off the table\nrannalta: from the beach\nmaalta: from the land\nmereltä: from the sea\n\n from a person, object or other entity\n\nhäneltä: from him/her/them\n\n with the verb lähteä (stop)\n\nlähteä tupakalta: stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now, lit. 'leave from the tobacco')\nlähteä hippasilta: stop playing tag (hippa=tag, olla hippasilla=playing tag)\n\n to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something\n\nhaisee pahalta: smells bad\nmaistuu hyvältä: tastes good\ntuntuu kamalalta: feels awful\nnäyttää tyhmältä: looks stupid\nkuulostaa mukavalta: sounds nice\n\nEstonian\nThe ablative case in Estonian is the ninth case and has a similar function to that in Hungarian.\n\nHungarian\nThe ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe movement away from, as well as a concept, object, act or event originating from an object, person, location or entity. For example, one walking away from a friend who gave him a gift could say the following:\n\na barátomtól jövök (I am coming (away) from my friend).\na barátomtól kaptam egy ajándékot (I got a gift from my friend).\n\nWhen used to describe movement away from a location, the case may only refer to movement from the general vicinity of the location and not from inside of it. Thus, a postától jövök would mean one had been standing next to the post office before, not inside the building.\n\nWhen the case is used to refer to the origin of a possible act or event, the act/event may be implied while not explicitly stated, such as : I will defend you from the robber.\n\nThe application of vowel harmony gives two different suffixes: -tól and -től. These are applied to back-vowel and front-vowel words, respectively.\n\nHungarian has a narrower delative case, similar to ablative, but more specific: movement off/from a surface of something, with suffixes -ról and -ről.\n\nTurkic languages\n\nAzerbaijani\n\nThe ablative in Azerbaijani () is expressed through the suffixes -dan or -dən:\n\nEv – evdən\nHouse – from/off the house\n\nAparmaq – aparmaqdan\nTo carry – from/off carrying\n\nTatar\nThe ablative in Tatar () is expressed through the suffixes -дан or -дән or -тан or -тән or -нан or -нән:\n\nӨй - өйдән\nHouse - from/off the house\n\nTurkish\nThe ablative in", "instruction": " What is the function of the ablative case in Modern Persian?"}

{"topic": "Kotoshōhō Yoshinari", "document": "is a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Kashiwa, Chiba. He made his debut in November 2017 and reached the top makuuchi division in May 2020. He wrestles for Sadogatake stable. His highest rank has been maegashira 3. He was runner-up in the January 2023 tournament, also winning the Fighting Spirit prize.\n\nCareer\nHe began sumo in the first grade of elementary school, and won the national junior high school championship in his third year of junior high. He went to Saitama Sakae High School, famous for its sumo program, and was classmates with Naya and Tsukahara. After graduating from high school he joined Sadogatake stable, recruited by ex-sekiwake Kotonowaka, to whom he had a connection as Kotonowaka's eldest son was a fellow member of Kashiwa City's boys sumo club. He made his professional debut in November 2017, using the shikona of , based on his own name. In his first tournament on the banzuke in January 2018 he took part in a playoff with Tsukahara for the jonokuchi division championship after both finished with a 6–1 record. He reached the makushita division in September 2018 and although he was unable to secure a winning record he returned to makushita in January 2019 and five straight winning records saw him reach elite sekitori status after the September 2019 tournament. To mark the occasion he changed his shikona to Kotoshōhō Yoshinari. \n\nKotoshōhō won the jūryō division yūshō or championship with a 12–3 record in March 2020, only his third tournament in the division, and this earned him promotion to the top division for the Natsu tournament scheduled for May 2020. He has been praised by commentators for his calm demeanour and his maturity in the dohyō despite being only 20 years of age at the time of his promotion. Three further winning records brought him to the joi-jin rank of maegashira 3 for the January 2021 tournament, where he managed only two wins facing top-ranked opposition. He missed several days of the March 2021 tournament due to injury, only managing to record one win, and he was demoted back to jūryō for the May 2021 tournament. He won his second jūryō division championship in January 2022 with an 11–4 record, and returned to the top division for the March 2022 tournament.\n He secured a winning record of 9–6 there, but then had losing records in the next four tournaments. From the rank of maegashira 13 in January 2023, he entered the final day level with ōzeki Takakeishō on 11–3, and fought him for the championship in the final match of the tournament, the first maegashira to be in such a position since 15-day tournaments were established in 1949. Although he was defeated and missed out on the Outstanding Performance award, he did receive the Fighting Spirit award for his 11–4 performance, the best of his career. Kotoshōhō withdrew on Day 10 of the May 2023 tournament due to a patellar subluxation in his left knee, after having suffered eight consecutive defeats. He also had sprained his right ankle during the spring jungyō. He nevertheless expressed his desire to return to the competition and was later scheduled to return on Day fourteen.\n\nFighting style\nAccording to his Japan Sumo Association profile, Kotoshoho prefers a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent’s mawashi and his most common winning kimarite are yori-kiri (force out) and oshi dashi (push out).\n\nPersonal life\nKotoshōhō has a younger brother who also wrestles as a professional in the same stable under the ring name Kototebakari, a shikona inspired by both brothers' real surname. \nIn June 2023, Kotoshōhō held a press conference at Ryōgoku Kokugikan to announce his engagement to a woman of the same age, living in Yame, Fukuoka Prefecture, to whom he proposed after the May 2023 tournament. Although he and his wife don't plan to live together until August of the same year, it was announced in July that the couple were expecting their first child, a boy.\n\nCareer record\n\nSee also\nList of active sumo wrestlers\nList of sumo tournament top division runners-up\nList of sumo second division tournament champions\nGlossary of sumo terms\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1999 births\nLiving people\nJapanese sumo wrestlers\nSumo people from Chiba Prefecture\nSadogatake stable sumo wrestlers", "instruction": " What notable achievements has Kotoshōhō Yoshinari had outside of sumo?"}

{"topic": "Michigan Supreme Court", "document": "The Michigan Supreme Court is the highest court in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is Michigan's court of last resort and consists of seven justices. The Court is located in the Michigan Hall of Justice at 925 Ottawa Street in Lansing, the state capital.\n\nOperations\nEach year, the Court receives approximately 2,000 new case filings. In most cases, the litigants seek review of Michigan Court of Appeals decisions, but the Supreme Court also hears cases of attorney misconduct (through a bifurcated disciplinary system comprising an investigation and prosecution agency – the Attorney Grievance Commission – and a separate adjudicative agency – the Attorney Discipline Board), judicial misconduct (through the Judicial Tenure Commission), as well as a small number of matters over which the Court has original jurisdiction.\n\nThe Court issues a decision by order or opinion in all cases filed with it. Opinions and orders of the Court are reported in an official publication, Michigan Reports, as well as in Thomson West's privately published North Western Reporter.\n\nAdministration of the courts\nThe Court's other duties include overseeing the operations of all state trial courts. It is assisted in this endeavor by the State Court Administrative Office, one of its agencies. The Court's responsibilities also include a public comment process for changes to court rules, rules of evidence and other administrative matters. The court has broad superintending control power over all the state courts in Michigan.\n\nArticle 6, Section 30 of the Michigan Constitution creates the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission. This is an agency within the judiciary, having jurisdiction over allegations of judicial misconduct, misbehavior, and infirmity. The Supreme Court is given original, superintending control power, and appellate jurisdiction over the issue of penalty (up to and including removal of judges from office).\n\nHistory\nThe Michigan Supreme Court can be dated back to the Supreme Court of Michigan Territory, established in 1805 with three justices. These justices served for indefinite terms. In 1823, the terms of justices were limited to four years.\n\nThe Michigan Supreme Court was the only court created by the first Michigan constitution in 1835. It had three members and each also oversaw one of the three judicial circuits, located in Detroit, Ann Arbor and Kalamazoo. The court needed a quorum of two to operate and members were appointed to seven-year terms by the governor with the consent of the senate. In 1838, Justice William A. Fletcher proposed a new plan for the court that the legislature approved. This increased the number of circuits to four and thus expanded the bench to four justices, but left the quorum at two.\n\nIn 1848, the court was expanded to five justices and the 1850 Michigan constitution provided that they be elected for six-year terms. In 1858, the Circuit Courts were split from the Supreme Court, so justices now only served on the Michigan Supreme Court and reduced its size to only four justices, one of whom was the Chief Justice.\n\nIn 1887, the court was expanded to five justices each serving for ten years. The court was again expanded in 1903 to eight justices serving terms of eight years. In 1964, the new state constitution provided that the next justice to leave the court would not be replaced to reduce the court to seven members, which was achieved when Justice Theodore Souris declined to run for re-election in 1968, leaving the court with seven members since January 1, 1969.\n\nComposition\nThe Supreme Court consists of seven justices who are elected to eight-year terms. Candidates are nominated by political parties and are elected on a nonpartisan ballot. Supreme Court candidates must be qualified electors, licensed to practice law in Michigan for at least five years, and under 70 years of age at the time of election. Vacancies are filled by appointment of the Governor until the next general election. Every two years, the justices elect a member of the Court to serve as Chief Justice.\n\nThe Michigan Constitution allows vacancies on the state Supreme Court to be initially filled by the Governor, with that appointee serving until the next general election, at which time the elected winner is seated to fill the remaining portion of the vacated term.\n\nCurrent justices\n\nFollowing the 2012 election, the court had a 4–3 conservative Republican majority, with Robert P. Young Jr. serving as Chief Justice. After the resignation of Justice Diane Hathaway and appointment of David Viviano in 2013, there was a 5–2 Republican majority. After the 2018 election, the court reverted to a 4–3 conservative Republican majority with the election of Megan Cavanagh. \n\nIn 2020, Bridget Mary McCormack was re-elected as Chief Justice and Elizabeth M. Welch was elected as Justice, giving the Democrats a 4–3 majority on the court starting January 1, 2021. This also made the court majority female for the fourth time in state history.\n\nThe current justices of the Michigan Supreme Court are:\n\nSee also\n\n Judiciary of Michigan\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n Michigan Supreme Court\n Michigan Supreme Court Commentary\n Michigan Supreme Court Historical Society\n\n \nMichigan state courts\nBuildings and structures in Lansing, Michigan\n1837 establishments in Michigan\nLegal history of Michigan\nMichigan\nCourts and tribunals established in 1837", "instruction": " What is the process for appointing a justice to fill a vacation on the Michigan Supreme Court before the next general election?"}

Since its release, it has remained a local cult classic in Vermont.\n\nMany details of the film can be read as poking fun at certain public figures and groups in Vermont; for example, Fred describes himself as being affiliated with the \"Regressive Party,\" a clear reference to the Vermont Progressive Party. The fictional incumbent Representative William Blachly also bears a definite resemblance to Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy. Parts of the film also satirizes American politics in ways that the voice-over narration makes explicit—for example, it is made very clear at the beginning of the film that Fred's main reason in running for office is that he lacks the skills, strength, and education for any other job that would be lucrative enough to pay his father's costly medical bills. It is also made obvious during the campaign section of the film that Fred's victory is entirely the result of his charisma and charm, rather than of any amount of political savvy or wisdom.\n\nTuttle would go on to run for a seat in the United States Senate in 1998. He won the Republican nomination but was defeated by Democratic incumbent Senator Patrick Leahy, whom Tuttle famously endorsed.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n  BBC News Article: Fred Tuttle\n  New York Times review\n\nAmerican political comedy films\nAmerican political drama films\nAmerican mockumentary films\n1996 films\nFilms set in Vermont\nFilms shot in Vermont\nFilms about elections\n1996 comedy-drama films\nAmerican comedy-drama films\n1990s English-language films\n1990s American films", "instruction": " What specific political figure or group was the inspiration behind the creation of the \"Regressive Party\" in the film \"Man with a Plan\"?"}

He reigned from 1462 to 1471.\n\nFamily\nThe Moro family settled in Venice in the 5th century when Stephanus Maurus, a great-grandson of Maurus, built a church on the island of Murano. Cristoforo was the eleventh person from the family to be elected doge. His dogaressa was Cristina Sanudo.\n\nLife\nAfter graduating from university, Moro held various public offices. He was the Venetian ambassador to the Popes Eugene IV and Nicholas V. Saint Bernardino of Siena was said to have prophesied that Moro would one day become doge, and as the fulfillment of a solemn vow Moro had the Church of Saint Giobbe built and dedicated to Bernardino's memory. He bequeathed his fortune to various charitable organizations and foundations, including the Church of Saint Giobbe.\n\nDoge\nMoro's reign was marked by the beginning of a long war between Venice and the Turks. In 1463 Pope Pius II sent Moro a consecrated sword with the intention of convincing Venice to join the anti-Turk alliance. The reaction in Venice was initially hesitant as the Republic's main priority was their economic interests.\n\nIn April 1463, 10 years after the conquest of Constantinople, Turkish troops occupied the Venetian fortress of Argos in Greece. The Latin Patriarch Cardinal Johannes Bessarion traveled to Venice to call on the Republic to join the \"defense of the faith\"; i.e. join the war against the Turks. That same year a coalition was formed between Venice, Hungary and the Albanian prince Skanderbeg with the blessing of the Pope to counter the threat of Sultan Mehmed II's aggressive policy of conquest. The coalition succeeded in temporarily halting Turkish expansion; however, the new territorial limits acquired by the Turks in their conquests had by and large been accepted.\n\nIn 1469 the Venetian fleet commander Niccolò Canal retook the town of Ainos in Thrace, but he was not able to defend the island of Negroponte (Euboea), a major granary of Venice, from Turkish attack. Euboea was conquered by the Sultan while inflicting enormous losses on the Venetian forces.\n\nThe Republic faced further threats from the northern Italian cities who coveted Venetian land, as well as from the French king Louis XI who was seeking to expand Lombardy at the expense of Venice.\n\nTomb\nMoro's tomb is located in the sanctuary of the Church of Saint Giobbe.

The son of Zeus hunted it for fifty days and finally slayed the beast. The Thespian king entertained him as a guest in a brilliant fashion during that span of time. Heracles was drunk and slept unwittingly with each of the king's fifty daughters, including Nice, thinking that his bed-fellow was always the same. Thespius intended this to happen because he strongly desired that all his daughters should have children by Hercules. In another version of the myth, the latter had an intercourse with Nice and her siblings for one week; seven laid with Heracles each night.\n\nIn some accounts, Heracles bedded in a single night with Nice and her sisters except for one who refused to have a connection with him. The hero thinking that he had been insulted, condemned her to remain a virgin all her life, serving him as his priest.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\n Apollodorus, The Library with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1921.

{"topic": "Isotopes of silver", "document": "Naturally occurring silver (47Ag) is composed of the two stable isotopes 107Ag and 109Ag in almost equal proportions, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). 40 radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 105Ag with a half-life of 41.29 days, 111Ag with a half-life of 7.43 days, and 112Ag with a half-life of 3.13 hours.\n\nAll of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 3 minutes. This element has numerous meta states, with the most stable being 108mAg (half-life 439 years), 110mAg (half-life 249.86 days) and 106mAg (half-life 8.28 days).\n\nIsotopes of silver range in atomic weight from 91.960 u (92Ag) to 132.969 u (133Ag). The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 107Ag, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. The primary decay products before 107Ag are palladium (element 46) isotopes and the primary products after are cadmium (element 48) isotopes.\n\nThe palladium isotope 107Pd decays by beta emission to 107Ag with a half-life of 6.5 million years. Iron meteorites are the only objects with a high enough palladium/silver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107Ag abundance. Radiogenic 107Ag was first discovered in the Santa Clara meteorite in 1978.\n\nThe discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event. 107Pd versus 107Ag correlations observed in bodies, which have clearly been melted since the accretion of the Solar System, must reflect the presence of live short-lived nuclides in the early Solar System.\n\nList of isotopes \n\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | 92Ag\n| rowspan=2 | 47\n| rowspan=2 | 45\n| rowspan=2 | 91.95971(43)#\n| rowspan=2|1# ms[>400 ns]\n| β+ \n| 92Pd\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n|- \n| p \n| 91Pd\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | 93Ag\n| rowspan=3 | 47\n| rowspan=3 | 46\n| rowspan=3 | 92.95019(43)#\n| rowspan=3| 228(16) ns\n| β+ \n| 93Pd\n| rowspan=3|9/2+#\n| rowspan=3|\n| rowspan=3| \n|-\n| p \n| 92Pd\n|-\n| β+, p\n| 92Rh\n|-\n| rowspan=2| 94Ag\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 47\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 47\n| rowspan=2| 93.94374(43)#\n| rowspan=2| 27(2) ms\n| β+ (>99.8%)\n| 94Pd\n| rowspan=2| 0+#\n| rowspan=2| \n| rowspan=2| \n|-\n| β+, p (<0.2%)\n| 93Rh \n|-\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 94m1Ag\n| rowspan=2 colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 1350(400)# keV\n| rowspan=2|470(10) ms\n| β+ (83%)\n| 94Pd\n| rowspan=2|(7+)\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2| \n|-\n| β+, p (17%)\n| 93Rh\n|-\n| rowspan=4 style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 94m2Ag\n| rowspan=4 colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 6500(550)# keV\n| rowspan=4| 400(40) ms\n| β+ (~68.4%)\n| 94Pd\n| rowspan=4| (21+)\n| rowspan=4|\n| rowspan=4|\n|-\n| β+, p (~27%)\n| 93Rh\n|-\n| p (4.1%)\n| 93Pd\n|-\n| 2p (0.5%)\n| 92Rh\n|-\n| rowspan=2|95Ag\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 47\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 48\n| rowspan=2|94.93569(43)#\n| rowspan=2|1.78(6) s\n| β+ (97.7%)\n| 95Pd\n| rowspan=2|(9/2+)\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n|-\n| β+, p (2.3%)\n| 94Rh\n|-\n| style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 95m1Ag\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 344.2(3) keV\n| <0.5 s\n| IT\n| 95Ag\n| (1/2−)\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 95m2Ag\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 2531.3(15) keV\n| <16 ms\n| IT\n| 95Ag\n| (23/2+)\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 95m3Ag\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 4860.0(15) keV\n| <40 ms\n| IT\n| 95Ag\n| (37/2+)\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=2|96Ag\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 47\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:right\" | 49\n| rowspan=2|95.93074(10) \n| rowspan=2|4.45(3) s\n| β+ (95.8%)\n| 96Pd\n| rowspan=2|(8+)\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n|-\n| β+, p (4.2%)\n| 95Rh\n|-\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 96m1Ag\n| rowspan=2 colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-indent:2em\" | 0(50)# keV\n| rowspan=2| 6.9(5) s\n| β+ (85.1%)\n| 96Pd\n| rowspan=2| (2+)\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n|-\n| β+, p (14.9%)\n| 95Rh\n|-\n| style=\"text-indent:1em\" | 96m2Ag\n| colspan", "instruction": " What is the significance of the correlation between the 107Pd and 107Ag isotopes in the context of the age of the Solar System?"}
{"topic": "Duncan MacGregor Crerar", "document": "Duncan MacGregor Crerar (4 December 1836 – 11 March 1916) was a Scottish poet who spent much of his adult life in western Ontario and New York City, writing sentimental poetry commemorating places and friends in Scotland. A native Gaelic speaker, he wrote primarily in English, with Gaelic phrases and diction. He was referred to by some contemporaries as \"The Breadalbane Bard\" or \"Bard of Amulree\". In his book Scottish Poets in America (New York, NY, 1889), John D. Ross described him:\n\nIn conclusion, we would state that Mr. Crerar is one of the most genial of men, kind, sympathetic, and generous in all his actions. In his own quiet, unobtrusive way, and unknown to the world, he has rendered assistance to many when they found the clouds of adversity hovering over them: and there are few men similarly circumstance who can boast of so large and so sincere a following of friends.\n\nParents \n\nCrerar was born in Amulree, Glenquaich, Perthshire, Scotland, the son of Alexander Crerar (or MacKintosh) (1801 – before 1861), a mason and shepherd, and Janet MacGregor (1810 – 15 August 1885).  His son eulogized him in his poem \"Mementoes of My Father's Grave\", written on 1 November 1878 in New York, and dedicated to Duncan's brother Alexander M. Crerar (born 9 July 1849) (published in the Celtic Magazine, Inverness, January 1883):\n\nMementoes of My Father's Grave\n\nSoft, silky leaves of freshest green,\nWhich grew upon my father's grave;\nMementoes hallowed of a man\nWhose heart was warm, sincere, and brave.\n\nOf humble sphere, but noble aims,\nHe calmly stemmed life's stormy sea;\nUpright and manly, frank and pure,\nA trusty friend, and true was he.\n\nA loving husband, faithful, kind;\nA tender father, wise, discreet;\nOur weal his chief concern, delight,\nHis happy home made labour sweet.\n\nHis words were few; for well he weighed\nEach thought and subject ere he spoke;\nIn humour rich; and oft essayed\nA simple, pleasant, harmless joke.\n\nMy father! thy blest memory\nI dearly cherish day by day;\nAnd for its sake I'll prize these leaves,\nWhich grew about thy sacred clay.\n\nAnd when life's course with me is run --\nWhen, soon or late, I must resign\nThis earthly frame-oh, may it rest\nBeneath a turf as green as thine!\n\nHe eulogized his mother Janet in the poem, \"S'Rioghal Ma Dhream\" (\"My Race is Royal\"—Motto of Clan MacGregor), \"In Affectionate Remembrance of My Beloved Mother. Died at Amulree, Dunkeld, Scotland, August 15, 1885\", written 25 August 1885 in New York City:\n\n\"Mother is dead!\" heart-rending news to me.\nDead my belovèd! Oh how keen my pain!\nOn earth, alas! we ne'er shall meet again:\n\"Mother is dead!\" sent o'er the cold, deep sea!\n\"My Race is Royal,\" motto of thy line;\nIf Royal here, they welcome Royal there,\nWhere, free from every sorrow, trouble, care,\nThou dwellest in the light and love Divine!\nTo me henceforth this life will lonesome be.\nDeep was thy love, self-sacrificing, kind.\nNow do I feel all that thou wert to me,\nSince thou art gone and I am left behind.\nIn gloomy sadness mourns for thee thy son.\nFather, forgive: Thy will, not mine, be done!\n\nBirth \n\nDuncan MacGregor Crerar was born at Amulree, Glenquaich, Perthshire on 4 December 1837 [Perth Pamphlets, v.18].  He received a good education, studying under Robert Sinclair, and was destined by his parents to join the Presbyterian ministry. He abandoned these intentions, however, on the death of his father.\n\nEmigration to North America \n\nIn 1857 he went to Canada, where he worked “in mercantile pursuits”. There he met many former friends from Amulree. Soon after his arrival, he entered the Active Militia as a member of Company \"A\" of Perth, Ontario, and served on the frontier during the Fenian Raids of 1865. John Ross states that \"...in recognition of his valuable services, the Canadian Government, when under the direction of his warm friend, the Honourable Alexander Mackenzie, gazetted him Honorary Lieutenant of the company with which he served.\" [John Ross, Scottish Poets in America, 37]. It is probable that Crerar had known Mackenzie, a future Canadian Prime Minister, for a long time, as both came from Dunkeld, Perthshire.\n\nAfter his military service, Crerar wrote for The Stratford Beacon, in Stratford, Ontario. He went to Toronto and studied for a short session. He then left for New York City, where he furthered his journalistic career. At the time of his marriage in 1869 he was the Assistant Manager of the Scottish American Journal of New York.\n\nHe returned to Scotland to wed. On 4 August 1869, he married Jessie Anderson Campbell (born circa 1842 - died before 1916) at the Free Church Manse, of Bridge of Perth, Kilmadock, Perth. Jessie Anderson Campbell was the 27-year-old daughter of Donald Campbell, a hotelkeeper of Langton, and Mary Campbell.\n\nCrerar resided in New York until around 1905. Poems written after 1905 indicate that he returned to Scotland to live out his life. He dedicated several of these later poems to citizens of Crieff, where he spent his final years.\n\nIn religion, he was a liberal Presbyterian, attending regularly the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, led by the Reverend Dr. Hall. In Canada he joined the Free Masons, and was an officeholder in the Blue Lodge and Royal Arch. He was also a founding and active member of the Burns Society of New York City.\n\nDeath \n\nCrerar died in  Crieff, Perthshire, Scotland at age 78. He was found in his bed at home at Westview, Burrell Street at 8:30 in the morning. It was recorded that he was the widower of Jessie Campbell. His occupation was recorded as poet, and an annuitant of an Andrew Carnegie Trust. His brother Donald of Aberfoyle reported the death.\n\nPoetic works \n\nCrerar is perhaps best remembered for his Robert Burns, an Anniversary Poem, (London, M. Ward, 1885), which \"... was read before the Burns Society of New York at the celebration of the 126th anniversary of the birthday of the Scottish National Bard\":\n\nExcerpt from “A Poem Commemorating Robbie Burns”\n\nHe touched our country’s ancient harp\nWith truest patriotic fire;\nForth thrilling came soul-stirring strains,\nMan’s nobler actions to inspire.\nThe cottar’s fireside, ‘neath his spell,\nBecomes at once a hallowed shrine;\nHis hymn to Mary swells the heart,\nAnd fills the eye his Auld Lang Syne.\n*    *    *\t*\t*\t*\nNot to his native land alone\nHis genius and his fame belong,\nIn other climes is treasured dear\nHis matchless legacy of song.\nHis melodies have echoing gone\nTo continents and isles afar;\nThey cheer and gladden hearts alike\n‘Neath Southern Cross and Polar Star.\n\nIn 1890, he published Whistle Blinkie: A Collection of Songs for the Social Circle (Glasgow: David Robertson & Co., 1890).\n\nAnother poem receiving some further reference was \"My Bonnie Rowan Tree\", dedicated to his brother John Crerar, and written in New York on September 25, 18", "instruction": " What specific events or experiences inspired Duncan MacGregor Crerar to abandon his plans for the Presbyterian ministry and instead pursue a career in journalism?"}

{"topic": "Alice Corkran", "document": "Alice Abigail Corkran was an Irish author of children's fiction and an editor of children's magazines. Born in France to Irish parents, she grew up in the stimulating environment of her mother's literary salon. She was a playmate of Robert Browning's ageing father, and still had his workbooks in her possession when she died. As well as writing a number of well received novels, she edited first the Bairn's Annual and then The Girl's Realm, being the founder of that magazine's Guild of Service and Good Fellowship, which maintained a cot at the Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, among other charitable works.\n\nEarly life\nAlice Corkran was born in Paris, France to John Frazer Corkran (18081884) and Louisa Walsh (18231892). She was the second oldest of five children: three girls, and two boys. Her father began life as a dramatist and had a play, The Painter of Italy, well received at the Theatre Royal, Dublin on 9 March 1840, but by that time he was already in Paris. He was the Paris correspondent of the Morning Herald and the Evening Standard.\n\nJohn was in Paris for all the excitement of the 1848 revolution and he wrote a book: History of the National Constituent Assembly from May, 1848 (1849) that was said to be still the standard text on the constituent assembly more than 30 years later.\n\nLouisa Corkran married her husband in Dublin in June or July 1839. They were soon in Paris where their five children were born; the first, Henrietta, was born on 21 October 1841.\n\nLouisa's salon in Paris was frequented by M. Vigny, and by the whole literary group that acknowledged him as the leader. The poet Robert Browning was a friend, and his wife travelled twice a year to Paris to visit Louisa.\n\nThackeray, then writing Vanity Fair, was also a friend of the family and almost acted as a fairy godfather to the children. When the family returned to London, her house in Bloomsbury became a rendezvous for many eminent men and women of letters.\n\nAlice Corkran grew up in a stimulating environment. She was the playmate of Robert Browning's father, and she used to accompany the old man on his rambles along the quays in search of subjects to sketch. She was the old man's favourite. She published some of his sketches to illustrate an article about the Brownings in The Girl's Realm in 1905. She still had his old notebooks with their sketches when she died.\n\nCorkran was educated at home and studied art in Paris until the family had to leave Paris following some reverses of fortune. They moved to Bloomsbury in London.\n\nWorks\n\nLonger works\nCorkran's fame rested in particular on her first novel Bessie Lang as well as her other novel Down the Snow Stairs. These works were cited occasionally to reference the author. Both attracted very positive critical attention on first publication. Of Bessie Lang reviewers said:\n\"so sweet, so simple, and at the same time so strongly descriptive is the style in which this tale is told that it seems to have caught some feature of merit from each part in the telling.\"The Examiner\n\"If Miss Corkran is a novice in fiction, as her title-page would seem to indicate, she is a writer who may well have a future before her, for the pretty and touching tale she here gives us is told with a simplicity and absence of straining after effect which bespeak a true feeling for her art, whilst the beauty and pathos of many touches in it are unquestionable.\"The Graphic\n\"Indeed, so many the principal elements of a high-class work are undoubtedly to be found in \" Bessie Lang,\" that the authoress may claim to have stepped at once into foremost place amongst contemporary writers of fiction. The reader will probably not have perused many pages without being agreeably reminded of such writings as those of Mrs. Gaskell, Mrs. Oliphant, Mrs. Craik, Miss Thackeray, whose works edify and interest by their purity and power rather than any perceptible straining after effect.\"Birmingham Daily Gazette\n\nDown the Snow Stairs also attracted a favourable critical response:\n\"It is quite as enthralling as \"Alice in Wonderland,\" but much more human and real. At the same time, every page is bathed in the golden and undying light of romance, without which a child's story-book is as uninteresting to little folks as an auctioneer's catalogue.\"Sheffield Independent\n\"We have rarely read anything better of its kind than \"Down the Snow Stairs\".\"The Scotsman\n\"one of the most charming children’s stories imaginable, and will assuredly be very popular\"John Bull\n\"We have to place this book alongside of Carrol's Alice in Wonderland...A better and brighter book we have not read for a long time.\"Aberdeen Press and Journal\n\nAfter 1890, all of Corkran's longer works were non-fiction. Her non-fiction works were also well received by critics, and one of her obituaries referred to her book on Leighton as an excellent critical biography.\n\nThe source for the following data is the British Library Catalogue (BL Cat.), supplemented and cross-checked against Kirk, Sutherland, Watson, Library Hub Discover, and the Circulating Library database, supplemented by searches of the used book trade. The year of publication has been corrected from the nominal year, where necessary, by checking for reviews of the books in newspaper archives.\n\nLegend for the column headings:\nCat.: Found in the Catalogue of the British Library\nBL: Digital copy online at the British Library\nIA: Digital copy online at the Internet Archive\nHT: Digital copy online at Hathi Trust\nMargery Merton's Girlhood is available online at Google Books, and Meg's Friend as a Gutenberg eText.\n   \nOne work stands out on the list as being very dissimilar from the others, The Fatal House. This is a cheaply-priced (one shilling) melodrama completely unlike Corkran's other output, and there are no references on the title page to her other works. As noted in the table above, it is available as an online text at the British Library. The Morning Post said of the book: \"Miss Alice Corkran has written a tale sufficiently full of mystery and horror to satisfy the most voracious appetite. \"The Fatal House\" exercises a baneful influence on all who reside under its roof. The history of its owners is one of crime, vice, and debauchery ; nothing but evil survives within its sin-tainted walls. Such ample evidence of this is adduced, that the unhappy wife of the last owner, in a state bordering on delirium, burns the house and its contents to the ground, thus lifting the curse which she feels has been laid upon it. It is an un- canny story from beginning to end, and its tone is morbid and unpleasant.\"\n\nAnthologies\nCorkran published three anthologies of her stories:\nThe Adventures of Mrs. Wishing-To-Be and Other Stories (see within longer works above) contained the title story, plus \"Willie and Mary in Search of Fairy Land\" and \"Wish-Day\".\nMischievous Jack and Other Stories contained \"Mischievous Jack and the Old Fisherman\" and \"A Little King\" which had both appeared in the first volume of The Bairn's Annual in 1885; and \"Boppy's Repentance\". \nThe Young Philistine, and Other Stories contained the title story, previously published as \"A Young Philistine\" in Merry England in 1885; \"Pere Perrault's Legacy\", which had first appeared as \"How Pere Perrault Spent his Legacy\" in Belgravia in July 1882; \"A Village Genius\" first published as \"Mademoiselle Angele\" in The Gentleman's Annual for 1881; and the lead story of the collection \"The English Teacher at the Convent\", which Sutherland said was notable among the short stories of Corkran, which \"have some charm\". The story is a version of \"Miss Martha's Bag\", which appeared in the first number of Merry England. The Athenaeum said of this collection that: \"We find in Miss Corkran’s work a delicacy of touch, a fine humour, and a pathos which give to these little stories something of the charm and finish of a miniature.\"\n\nThe Young Philist", "instruction": " What other notable works did Alice Corkran edit besides The Bairn's Annual and The Girl's Realm?"}

The project is expected to be completed by 2020.\n\nStrategic positioning \n\nAccording to plans made by the Qianhai administration, as the pilot district for cooperation between mainland China and Hong Kong and innovation in the service industry, Qianhai undertakes four functions:\n An area that will aim to facilitate innovation in the modern service industry\n An area that will aim to become a hub of modern services and modern service development\n A pilot area for closer cooperation between mainland China and Hong Kong\n A facilitator in the industrial reform and sustainable economic development of the Pearl River Delta\n\nFeatures\n\nLocation \nQianhai is situated in the Pearl River Delta. With the completion of railways and roads by 2020, Qianhai will be within a one-hour commuting radius of the Pearl River Delta and within a 30-minute commuting radius of Hong Kong. The main arteries of traffic in the region, including the Shenzhen-Zhongshan corridor, Shenzhen Western Port, Shenzhen North Station and Guangzhou-Shenzhen Yanjiang Highway all pass through Qianhai.\n\nIndustrial support \nThe city of Shenzhen, where Qianhai is located, is one of the most economically developed regions in the Pearl River Delta and mainland China. As one of the most economically productive cities in China, Shenzhen has the highest GDP per capita, foreign export volume, the number of patent applications and the number of patents owned per capita among all major cities in China.\n\nSpecial policies \nThe following policies were approved by the State Council on June 27, 2012.\n\nFinancial policies \n Qianhai shall experiment with the expansion of offshore RMB fund flow-back channels. Qianhai will support the development of Hong Kong as an offshore RMB settlement centre and establish a cross-border RMB innovation zone in order to facilitate the development of RMB financial services.\n Qianhai shall support the issuance of RMB loans from local banking institutions to international projects, and from Hong Kong-based banking institutions to Qianhai projects under the stipulations of the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA).\n Qianhai shall be supported in its efforts to establish an equity investment parent fund in Qianhai.\n Hasten the internationalization of Qianhai's financial market by opening up to Hong Kong under the stipulations of CEPA\n Qianhai supports the development of innovative financial instruments, and financial products that support the development of the real economy.\n Hong Kong and international banking institutions shall be encouraged to establish their headquarters in Qianhai in order to quicken the pace of the internationalization of Qianhai's financial industry.\n\nTaxation policies \n Eligible companies registered in Qianhai are subject to a 15 percent preferential corporate income tax rate.\n Eligible professionals who are employed in Qianhai are exempt from personal income tax.\n\nLegal policies \n Qianhai shall support Hong Kong arbitration agencies' establishment of affiliated agencies in Qianhai.\n Qianhai shall support the joint operation of mainland and Hong Kong law firms under CEPA and its supplementary agreements.\n\nHuman resource policies \n Qianhai's human resource management mechanism shall be innovated and relevant policies and measures shall be formulated to attract a professional, international workforce, including but not limited to professionals from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, as well as Chinese professionals who are currently working or studying abroad or those who have returned to China. \n Professionals with certification from Hong Kong shall be permitted to provide professional services, the boundary of which is confined to Qianhai and to the enterprises and residents of Qianhai.

{"topic": "Corrigin, Western Australia", "document": "Corrigin is a town in the central Wheatbelt region of Western Australia,  east-southeast of the state capital, Perth, Western Australia, along State Route 40. It is mostly a farming community focused on crops and sheep, and holds the world record of \"the most dogs in a ute\".\n\nHistory\nThe name \"Corrigin\", of Noongar Aboriginal origin, was first recorded in 1877 relating to a well in the area. The meaning of the name is unknown.\n\nBefore 1908 Corrigin's only connection with the rest of the state was the railway track that ran to Merredin and it was difficult to get anyone to take up land near the rabbit proof fence. Most of the land was once held by George Walton on a pastoral lease, which he ran from his homestead at Wogerlin rock. The first settlers to the area were Mr A. W. Goyder (the son of the South Australian Surveyor General), who took up the area on which the town now stands. He was followed by Jack Crossland then by Messrs Gayfer and Jose Bros.\n\nIn 1909, the Government planned to build a railway from Brookton on the Great Southern Railway to the town of Kunjin, 17 km west of Corrigin. Some time after, a line from Wickepin was also proposed, and the Government decided to locate the crossing point at Corrigin.\n\nA storm swept through the area in 1913 lashing the area with hailstones over  in diameter. The town was also deluged with over  of rain in a few hours. Standing crops were flattened, fences in low-lying areas were washed away and most of the town was submerged under at least  of water.\n\nIn 1913, a railway siding was built, and named \"Dondakin\" by railway authorities due to conflict with the name elsewhere. However, after much local protest, the siding was renamed Corrigin and gazetted on 15 May 1914. The railway line from Wickepin, Western Australia opened a month later, and the main office of the local Road Board moved to the town. In 1915, a school was built.\n\nIn 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. The bulk handling facility had been installed by November the following year and the first trial load of wheat was satisfactorily loaded.\n\nBy 1937 the town boasted a hall that cost £8,000 to build, a large state hotel, commercial buildings, bowling green, tennis course, golf course and one of the best showgrounds in the state. The town still had no adequate water scheme, there was no lack of well water but the water drawn was very hard.\n\nThe wheatbelt was struck by drought for much of 1939 and nearly all of 1940, described at the time as \"the worst in the states history\" until heavy rains arrived in December of that year.  Corrigin received  of drought-breaking rain over a couple of days.\n\nThe town was lashed by a violent storm on New Year's Day in 2013. Destructive winds and  of rain tore through over the course of an hour leaving behind fallen powerlines, uprooted trees, sheds torn apart and roofs ripped from homes.\n\nPresent day\n\nCorrigin has a population of 903 and is a key agricultural centre for a district focused mainly on wheat and sheep farming.  It is the location of a CBH management zone office, and in 1973 was the location of a \"type B\" wheat bin.\n\nIt contains a district high school (originally opened 1915 as a primary school), National Australia Bank branch, shopping facilities, accommodation (hotel, motel, caravan park), council offices and a telecentre. Each year, it hosts an agricultural show.\n\nThe town is a stop on the Transwa bus service to Esperance via Kulin/Hyden.\n\nA large rocky outcrop just to the east of town is Corrigin Rock.\n\nAbout 5 km west of town is the Corrigin dog cemetery, containing over 80 buried dogs.\n\nIn popular culture\nCorrigan, the fictional town in which the 2009 Craig Silvey novel Jasper Jones and the subsequent film are set, derives its name from Corrigin.\n\nClimate\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nShire of Corrigin\nDog in a Ute – includes photos and history of the event.\nCorrigin dog cemetery\n\nTowns in Western Australia\nWheatbelt (Western Australia)\nGrain receival points of Western Australia", "instruction": " What significant agricultural products, aside from wheat and sheep farming, does Corrgin and its surrounding district focus on?"}

{"topic": "Traffic in Metro Manila", "document": "According to a \"Global Driver Satisfaction\" survey conducted by the navigation app Waze in 2015, Metro Manila had the \"worst traffic on Southeast Asia\". Emerson Carlos, MMDA assistant general manager for operation has mentioned that in 2015, motor vehicle registrations in Metro Manila peaked at around 2.5 million.\n\nCauses\n\nInfrastructure problems \nOne of the primary causes of traffic density within Metro Manila is the current transportation infrastructure. Overall, there is a lack of quality infrastructure thus insufficient modes of mobility. The Duterte administration has promised that the coming years will be the, \"golden age of infrastructure\", with a record $168 billion to be spent on 5,000 projects across the nation”.\n\nRoad network\nThe road network of Metro Manila consists of radial (R-1 to R-10) and circumferential (C-1 to C-5) roads. These are the principal arteries within the city, however given the density of vehicles within the metropolis the roads have become inadequate. \"Metro Manila only has 1 km of road per 424 vehicles.\"\n\nFurthermore, the roads are of poor quality and do not receive maintenance. For example, in the scope of the entire country, \"Of the 31,400 km of national roads in the system, only about 45% (14,200 km) were assessed as being in good or fair condition in November 2011.”\n\nThe railway system\n\nThe current railways carry around 1.3 million passengers per day and spans  in 4 different lines. In 1998, plans for a railway expansion were implemented however only  of the planned  was actually built. As such, there exists a lack of an adequate non-road-based public transportation system. This is made evident with the problem of overcrowding during peak hours, which is at 4:00pm to 5:00 pm.\n\nRoad-based Public Transport\nIn Metro Manila, a variety of road-based public transport, such as tricycles, taxis, buses, and jeepneys which are all privately owned \"account for more than 50% of daily commuting trips, incur no subsidy, and with low productivity.” Meanwhile, \"car travel accounts for 30% of person-km, but constitutes 72% of the road traffic in terms of PCU-km.” The high number of vehicles on the road, which could be attributed to the high population, is one of the contributors to traffic congestion.\n\nUrban planning problems \nAccording to renowned urban planner Felino Palafox Jr., Metro Manila used to be an example of good urban planning until the mid-1970s. Palafox cited gated communities within central business districts, and the decision of local government units within the metropolitan area to \"throw away\" the Metro Manila Zoning Ordinance in the 1990s, as contributors to Metro Manila's urban planning \"mess\".\n\nUrban area expansion\nThe urban area of Metro Manila experiences a high growth rate in population, reaching a rate of . Within the period of 2000–2001, the city experienced a rate of 1.8%, resulting from the spillover of people from nearby towns, cities, and provinces. The urban planning of the city is not adequate vis a vis the high population density. Statistics show that the city must \"accommodate about an additional two million to six million by 2030.”\n\nTraffic congestion\n\"Today, traffic demand is at 12.8 million trips in Metro Manila. Most of these trips are made using the public transport owing to its 69% share of total trips. The lesser share of the trips is done by private mode and yet it is this mode that takes up 78% of road space.”  At the current state, the traffic volume within the metropolis already exceeds the capacities of existing roads.\n\nEconomic theories \nThe Roadmap for Transport Infrastructure for Metro Manila and its Surrounding Areas (Region III & Region IV-A) study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in response to the National Economic Development (NEDA) request for assistance in creating a guide for transport development in Metro Manila, the two regions of Central Luzon and CALABARZON. The guide was made to help NEDA deliberate on the contents of a short-term (2014 - 2016) and a medium term (2017 - 2022) transport investment program (TRIP).\n\nFor the short-term transport investment program (TRIP), it takes the goals of the Philippine Development Plan for 2011 to 2016 and makes it into projects in the transport sector. It has invested as much as 5% of the GDP in infrastructure as one of the five key strategies to achieving the TRIP. A huge difference from the previous investing rate, which was as low as 2% of the GDP.\n\nSame study has also found that during their research period, the Metro Manila traffic was costing the city and the people Php 2.4 billion per day in the year 2012. And, if no measures are undertaken, this transport cost can rise up to Php 6.0 billion per day in 2030. This is will be worst-case scenario in the increase of transport costs in Metro Manila and the areas of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite  if there will be no improvements done on the transport infrastructure of these areas and the Philippines overall.\n\nHigh population \nIn Busina: Current State, Alternatives and Emerging Filipino Values on Metro Manila Traffic, Metro Manila is classified as a global power city. This is because of majority of the industries present in the Philippines have located their offices in the National Capital Region (NCR). The city is also where all the foreign consulates and embassies are situated. This makes NCR the home of finance and commerce, hence the allure of in-migration from Filipinos from the provinces. Although this is not the main cause of road traffic in the city, the influx of people adds to it.\n\nYves Boquet, in his paper Battling Congestion in Manila: The EDSA Problem, quotes Robert Cervero in saying globalization, outsourcing and relocating much of the manufacturing activities are just some of the other causes that add to the high population in Metro Manila. These activities are mainly responsible for the influx that was previously mentioned. These activities are creating the job that appeal to people in the province to make the move.\n\nGrowing car ownership \nAnother cause of heavy traffic in the cities is the increase of the purchasing power of most people in Metro Manila. According to Euromonitor's Consumer Lifestyles in the Philippines (2015), young professionals in the Metro tend to buy small cars such as Toyota Wigo, Mitsubishi Mirage, and Honda Jazz that adds to road congestion. This is due to the affordability of the said cars, which gives them reason not to use public transport.\n\nReferring back to the study that dubs EDSA as the main passageway of the Greater Manila area, the city accounts for 35.7% of the Philippines’ economic output, 18% of its population and 28% of its motor vehicles. All of which are accommodated on barely 0.2% of the country's land area.\n\nAccording to the study of MMDA, in EDSA alone, there are 247,527 private 4-wheel vehicles that ply every day. It has the highest number compared to motorcycles, taxi, bus, and  trucks.\n\nPublic transportation system \n\nThe main modes of public transport in the Philippines are jeepneys, buses, taxis, trains and tricycles, all of which are readily available in Metro Manila. The introduction of transportation apps Grab and Uber came in 2013 and 2014, respectively, further widening the options of public transport. The Philippine traffic was considered the world's 9th worst in 2015 by Numbeo despite this range of public transport options. Although there is a wide array of choices, the public still spend an average of 45.5 minutes before reaching their workplace. This is why most Filipinos still find travelling via public transport inconvenient due to the high vehicle density and the unavoidable traffic congestion, according to Euromonitor's Consumer Lifestyles in the Philippines (2015).\n\nRoad accidents \nAccording to Metro Manila Accident Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS) data from 2008 to 2011 and a study of the severity", "instruction": " What are the specific infrastructure projects under the Duterte administration's golden age of infrastructure initiative aimed at improving traffic conditions in Metro Manila?"}
{"topic": "Dive briefing", "document": "A dive briefing or pre-dive briefing is a meeting of the diving team or dive group before the dive to allow the supervisor, dive leader or dive boat skipper to inform the attendees of the dive plan, contingency plans and emergency plans for the dive. The amount of detail presented should be appropriate to the dive, but there are several topics which are considered standard components of a dive briefing. The topics may vary depending on context.\n\nOn some occasions an expert or specialist may present part of the dive briefing, particularly aspects relating to specialised tasks, or vessel safety and procedures, but the overall responsibility is with the person responsible for the safety of the group.\n\nPurpose\nEach member of the dive team needs to understand the objectives of the dive, and their and the other members of the dive team's roles in the dive. The dive briefing allows exchange of this information. A competent professional diver already knows how to dive and carry out the routine and standard emergency diving procedures for the equipment and conditions in which they been trained. The divers may not be familiar with the dive site environmental details or the dive boat in use, or specific details of the objective of the dive, and the specific contingency and emergency response plans for the dive, so the briefing is an opportunity to inform them of relevant information they may not already know which might affect their safety and successful completion of the objectives of the dive. The briefing usually ends by soliciting questions to ensure understanding of task and assignments, and clarification of any uncertainty.\n\nRecreational divers may not be familiar with each other, or with local procedural details, such as the method of keeping track of who is in the water or back on the boat, buddy separation procedures, conditions for terminating the dive, recall signals, where to sit, water entry and exit procedures specific to the boat or site, how to stow their gear, and where the on-board safety equipment is kept, so this information forms part of the briefing, along with a description of the dive site, known local hazards,  local rules and regulations, environmental concerns and the planned route if the dive is to be guided. In some cases allocation of buddy pairs is included in the briefing.\n\nAudience\nThe dive briefing targets all personnel involved with the safety of the dive and particularly the divers.\n\nTopics\nAs a general rule the topics of a dive briefing are those things the team members need to know to carry out the planned dive safely and effectively, at the specific site, using the equipment provided, in the conditions as they appear to be on the day of the dive. It is not a necessary part of a dive briefing to inform the team of things that they are expected to know already as competent and qualified divers. A dive briefing for a training dive may include more skill, background and review information, but the briefing should be restricted to information that is likely to be necessary or useful on that specific dive. Additional information can be counterproductive if it distracts attention from the core material, or reduces the likelihood of the important information being remembered and used correctly during the diving operation. \n\nScientific diving example:\n\nStandard topics:\nObjectives of the dive\nResponsibilities of the dive team members – for a professional diving team this generally means their job designation for the dive\nReview of specific underwater tasks for the dive\nPlanned dive profile – Maximum depths and bottom times for the dive\nGeographical extent and features of the dive site\nReview of communications: hand or line signals relevant to the planned dive and foreseeable contingencies. \nThe presence and location of emergency equipment\nDiver recall signals available and the procedures to be followed.\nBuddy separation procedures\nContingency plans in case conditions become unfavourable\nAny known hazards specific to the dive site\nSignificant risks and safety issues identified in the risk assessment\nOther topics that may be relevant in some cases:\nPlanned and alternative methods of entry and exit into the water\nUse of emergency signalling equipment\nUse of special tools or equipment\nLost diver and diver rescue procedures appropriate for the site and dive plan\nProcedures for reducing the risk of developing decompression illness.\n\nThe PADI checklist for dive briefings for recreational diving lists 10 points:\nThe name of the dive site\nA description of the dive site. This should cover the layout and topography, points of interest and how to navigate between them, hazards specific to the site, sea conditions, general and maximum depth.\nThe role of the divemaster in the planned dive. How the divers can recognize the dive leader underwater, where the divemaster will be relative to the group during the dive and also what they will do to attract attention.\nEntry and exit techniques to be used for the dive\nThe planned procedures for the dive. This includes the suggested course, avoiding problems that may be caused by site hazards and sea conditions, recommendations for safety stops and air reserves, and the planned control of the group.\nEmergency procedures, which should include local protocols, buddy and group separation, low on air and out of air procedures, diver recall and surface signaling devices.\nReview of signals, in case some of the divers do not know the standard signals, and to inform them of local variations.\nRoster and buddy check. \nOrientation on the local environment. This includes informing the divers about the importance of not touching corals and other marine life and to be aware of their proximity to fragile organisms and their buoyancy and trim.\nPre-dive safety check\nSome of these cover things every trained diver should know, but experience has shown that entry level divers who only dive a few times a year tend to lose their knowledge and skills due to lack of practice, and need to be reminded.\n\nLegal status\nA dive briefing may be required in terms of statutory law, regulation, code of practice or organisational operations manual, for diving where there is a duty of care to employees or customers, or it may be merely recommended. In jurisdictions where recreational diving is unregulated, private recreational divers are generally not required to conduct or attend a briefing when they are diving solo or in independent buddy pairs and taking responsibility for their own safety and dive planning. Clubs will often provide a briefing for groups on club outings by an experienced diver who knows the area relatively well.\n\nReferences\n\nUnderwater diving procedures\nUnderwater diving safety", "instruction": " What specific communication signals will be used during the dive in case of emergencies or buddy separation?"}

{"topic": "It's Too Bad", "document": "\"It's Too Bad\" is a jazz-blues-influenced song written by Jimi Hendrix in 1969. Recorded by Hendrix that same year with American rock and funk musician Buddy Miles on drums and Grammy Award-winner Duane Hitchings on organ, the song was released a little more than thirty years later on the box set The Jimi Hendrix Experience.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1969, Jimi Hendrix's half-brother Leon Hendrix was suffering from a drug addiction and other problems. After Leon approached his successful half-brother Jimi and asked him for money, Hendrix wrote \"It's Too Bad\". On Tuesday, February 11, 1969, Hendrix was at Record Plant Studios in New York City producing the song \"I Can See\" for his friends in the Buddy Miles Express band at a recording session that went from 12:00 am to 4:00 am. With musician Buddy Miles on drums and Duane Hitchings on organ, the Buddy Miles Express band recorded \"I Can See\" (later retitled \"Destructive Love\") as Hendrix operated the mixing console. After the song was recorded, Hendrix came from behind the control room console to play guitar for two impromptu originals, \"World Traveler\", a guitar-and-organ duel between Hendrix and Hitchings, and \"It's Too Bad\". Both songs were recorded in one take. Hitchings remarked about his experience in recording with Hendrix, noting in 2010: \"Jamming with him was an amazing experience. I was scared to death!\".\n\nInterpretation\nIn the 1969 song track, Hendrix plays the role of both himself and his brother Leon. Backed by modern day blues, the song begins with \"It's too bad, Lord, my brother can't be here today\", to explore Hendrix's uneasy relationship with Leon, a theme that Hendrix also explored in his 1969 song, \"Shame, Shame, Shame\". In \"It's Too Bad\", the song notes how Hendrix sent Leon \"a-crying away\", and goes on to addresses Hendrix's uneasy relationship with other African-Americans, noting: \"So I'll go way across the tracks... And man they treat me the same way as you do... [They] say man until you come back, completely black, go back where you came from too\". Music reviews attributed the uneasy community connection expressed in the song to 1960s-1970s African-Americans' objection to Hendrix's \"colorblind vision\" by accusing Hendrix of \"achieving stardom by pandering to rock's largely white audience\". The song also makes reference to Hendrix's 1968 song \"Room Full of Mirrors\", which refers to a cracked mirror metaphor Hendrix used to convey the many sides of his emotions.\n\nHendrix Estate\nAfter Hendrix died without a will in 1970, his father Al received the rights to Hendrix's estate, including \"It's Too Bad\". A little more than thirty years after the song was recorded, it was one of four Hendrix songs newly discovered and added to The Jimi Hendrix Experience, a four disc box set. In reviewing the song on The Jimi Hendrix Experience (2000), producer and audio engineer Eddie Kramer noted about the tune: \"I think it's very clever, and very, very emotionally charged. It has a tremendous wallop\". Two years later, Hendrix's father died and Leon sued their father's estate and Hendrix's stepsister Janie to gain control over about one quarter of US$80 million. After Washington Superior Court judge Jeffrey M. Ramsdell limited Leon's claim to a single gold record left to him when his father died in 2002, Janie remarked in 2004 about the lawsuit: \"Jimi wrote a song about Leon and it was called, 'It's Too Bad'. The lyrics to that song are what this is all about\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Lyrics of \"It's Too Bad\" at \n Sheet music first page for \"It's Too Bad\" at \n\n1969 songs\nSongs written by Jimi Hendrix\nJimi Hendrix songs", "instruction": " What specific lyrics does the line \"They say man until you come back, completely black, go back where you came from too\" refer to in the context of \"It's Too Bad\"?"}

{"topic": "Metal vapor synthesis", "document": "In chemistry, metal vapor synthesis (MVS) is a method for preparing metal complexes by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with ligands.  In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands.  The method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. Ti(η6-toluene)2.  The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand. The metal evaporates upon being heated resistively or irradiated with an electron beam.  The apparatus operates under high vacuum. In a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.\n\nIn several case where compounds are prepared by MVS, related preparations employ conventional routes.  Thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and Mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of molybdenum(V) chloride in the presence of the diene.\n\nReferences\n\nChemical processes\nVacuum", "instruction": " What are the specific advantages of using metal vapor synthesis over traditional synthetic methods for preparing certain metal complexes?"}

This shark grows to about . It is fished commercially over much of its range and the IUCN considers it to be near threatened.\n\nDescription\nThe spot-tail shark is a spindle-shaped fish growing to about . It has a fairly long, pointed snout and moderately large eyes. The first dorsal fin is large and curved, while the second dorsal fin is small and low. The back and sides are grey and the belly white, and a long white streak is on the flank. This species can be distinguished from other requiem sharks found in tropical waters by the distinctive black tips to the second dorsal fin, the pectoral fins, and the lower lobe of the caudal fin. A ridge over the spine extends from the first to the second dorsal fin and a pit just in front of the upper lobe of the caudal fin. The upper teeth are serrated, oblique, and triangular. The Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni), which occupies a similar range, has similar black tips to the fins, but additionally has a black tip to its first dorsal fin. It lacks the ridge between the two dorsal fins and its upper teeth are also different, being slender, upright, and pointed.\n\nDistribution\nThe spot-tail shark is found in the tropical Indo-Pacific on continental and insular shelves commonly to a depth around , but possibly as deep as . Its range extends from the East African coast, Madagascar, and the Red Sea to India, Malaysia, China, the Philippines, and northern Australia.\n\nBiology\nThe spot-tail shark spends the day near the seabed and the night at the surface, most frequently around reefs. It is a predator and feeds on bony fish such as bonito and sea bass, cephalopods, and crustaceans.\n\nThe spot-tail shark is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta, giving birth once a year to a litter of one to eight live young. The gestation period is 10 months and the pups measure about  at birth. The young develop in shallow inshore waters. They grow rapidly at first, increasing in length by about  during their first year, but growth slows down thereafter. Females reach sexual maturity at two to three years and live for a maximum of seven years, while males live up to five years.\n\nStatus\nThe spot-tail shark is caught by line and gillnet in many parts of its range by small-scale commercial fisheries. The flesh is used for food, the liver for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fish meal.

It was begun in German Renaissance style under the architect Bernhard Zwitzel from Augsburg; this palace is today known as the \"German building\" (in German: Deutscher Bau). During a journey to Italy the duke got the inspiration for an additional palace.\n\nBehind the German building, close to the river Isar, the so-called \"Italian building\" (in German: Italienischer Bau) was constructed from 1537 to 1543  in Italian Renaissance style with a spacious courtyard and the palace chapel. It was  modeled in particular after the Palazzo Te in Mantua, and was the first Italian style palace  erected north of the Alps. Both buildings were connected by two wings. The paintings in the rooms were created by the Germans Hermanus Posthumus, Hans Bocksberger the Elder and Ludwig Refinger, while the stucco was done by Italian artists.\n\nWhen Count  William of Birkenfeld-Gelnhausen, who became later the first Duke in Bavaria, resided in the palace from 1780 onwards the facade of the German building was altered in French Neo-classical style by Carl Albert von Lespilliez and the so-called \"Birkenfeld Rooms\" were constructed. These rooms were decorated again with early wallpaper, when Crown Prince Ludwig lived here in the early 19th century, in the course of  his studies in Landshut. These rooms are today a part of the Residence Museum, together with the halls of the Italian building.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n  Landshut Residence\n\nHouses completed in 1543\nPalaces in Bavaria\nRoyal residences in Bavaria\nMuseums in Bavaria\nRenaissance architecture in Germany\nHistoric house museums in Germany\nRegistered historic buildings and monuments in Bavaria\nBuildings and structures in Landshut\n1543 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire", "instruction": " What significant events occurred in the Landshut Residence between the years 1600 and 1700?"}

It stars Lou Taylor Pucci, Chris Pine, Piper Perabo, and Emily VanCamp as four survivors of a viral pandemic attempting to stay alive amid the looming threat of becoming infected. Filmed in 2006, it received a limited release in the United States on September 4, 2009, following Pine's breakout performance in Star Trek earlier that year. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed $5.8 million.\n\nPlot\nA highly infectious virus, known as \"The World Ender Virus\", has spread worldwide, killing most of the population. Brothers Brian and Danny, along with Brian's girlfriend Bobby and Danny's friend Kate, plot a trip to take shelter at Turtle Beach, Texas, the brothers' childhood vacation home. To help them survive, they follow a set of rules created by Brian.\n\nOn their way to the beach, the group encounter survivor Frank and his infected daughter Jodie, whose vehicle has run out of fuel. The four escape from Frank when he attacks them, but after their car breaks down, they are forced to help Frank and Jodie to use his vehicle. At Frank's insistence, they travel to a nearby high school where a serum for the pandemic is rumored to have been developed. Upon arriving, Frank, Brian, Danny, and Kate discover that the serum does not work and the last remaining doctor is preparing to euthanize a group of infected children and himself. Meanwhile, Bobby catches the virus from Jodie, which she hides from the others. Frank is later forced to bring Jodie to a portable toilet, giving Brian the opportunity to leave them behind and take their vehicle.\n\nThe group stops at a hotel, unaware that it is occupied by armed survivalists. When the survivalists return, they force the women to accompany them until they uncover Bobby's infection and order the group away. Brian subsequently forces Bobby to leave the group.\n\nAs the group runs low on fuel, Brian kills two women to siphon their vehicle, but suffers a gunshot wound. While treating his brother's injury, Danny discovers that Brian is infected. Danny attempts to leave Brian behind that night, but Brian takes the keys to their vehicle. Refusing to surrender the keys, Brian goads Danny into killing him so he will not die alone from the virus. Danny and Kate arrive at Turtle Beach the next morning, but Danny realizes that without his brother, the place that seemed special to them as children is now desolate.\n\nCast\n Lou Taylor Pucci as Danny\n Chris Pine as Brian\n Piper Perabo as Bobby\n Emily VanCamp as Kate\n Christopher Meloni as Frank\n Kiernan Shipka as Jodie\n Mark Moses as Doctor\n\nAdditionally, Josh Berry, Tim D.

{"topic": "Irish Republican Army–Abwehr collaboration", "document": "The Irish Republican Army (IRA), a paramilitary group seeking to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and unify Ireland, shared intelligence with the Abwehr, the military intelligence service of Nazi Germany, during the  Second World War.\n\nContext\n\nConquest of Ireland was not a strategic goal for Nazi Germany before or during World War II. A plan existed for a potential invasion of Ireland, Operation Green, but it was more a diversionary tactic than an actual plot to take over the territory.\n\nWhat Nazi Germany hoped was to see Ireland remain neutral.\n\nWhen German attempts to gain air superiority over Great Britain as part of the Battle of Britain, seen as a potential precursor to Operation Sea Lion, were repulsed Ireland largely ceased to be of much interest.\n\nIRA-Abwehr involvement throughout the period can be broken up into three phases:\n Coordination missions with the IRA preceding the French campaign,\n Military missions directed against Britain for the purposes of gathering technical and weather data\nSending German soldiers into the Irish ranks\n Political missions against Britain undertaken later in the war, when the threat of direct German action against Britain had receded.\n\nEach phase had similar characteristics: a lack of planning, and a lack of capabilities of all the organisations concerned. German efforts to cultivate a working relationship with the IRA formed the basis for two wartime missions; that of Ernst Weber-Drohl, and that of Hermann Görtz, but the Abwehr later chose to rely on support mechanisms exclusive of the IRA.  Neither strategy proved viable and the entire process was one disaster after another. The missions of the first phase are covered in detail below, followed by a list of missions covering the two remaining phases.\n\n1937–1939: the first IRA contacts\nThe Abwehr had German agents in Ireland at this point. Joseph Hoven was an anthropology student who spent much of 1938 and 1939 in Northern Ireland and the province of Connacht. Hoven had befriended Tom Barry, an IRA member who had fought during the Anglo-Irish War and was still active within the organisation. They met frequently with a view to fostering links between the IRA and Germany.\n\nAt this time Barry had taken up the position of IRA Chief of Staff and it was within this capacity that he visited Germany in 1937 accompanied by Hoven, with a view to developing IRA/German relations.\n\nUpon his return to Ireland, Barry presented his findings to the IRA General Army Convention (GAC) during April 1938 in the guise of the \"Barry Plan\"a campaign focussed on targets in the border region of Northern Ireland. This plan was rejected by the GAC in favour of a competing plan to solely attack targets in Britainthe S-Plan sanctioned by Seán Russell.\n\nSeán MacBride, the son of John MacBride and Barry's Director of Intelligence, is also known to have handled a contact with an ex-German Army officer named Bismarck, who was in Ireland attempting to sell armoured cars to the Irish Army in 1937. The Intelligence director for the Dublin Brigade of the IRA, Con Lehane is also said to have helped MacBride with handling proposals about the IRA being absorbed into the Irish Military.\n\n1939–1940\nIn December 1938, the Abwehr II. Ast., located at Knochenhauerstraße, Hamburg, took an English-speaking agent on loan from the English section of the Deutscher Fichte-Bund headquarters (HQ) in Hamburg.  This agent was Oscar C. Pfaus.  Around this time, the IRA, independently of German Intelligence, began a series of attacks on targets in Britain following a declaration of war on the British State.  Pfaus was familiarised with media reports of this campaign and given a mission:\"to seek out the IRA leadership; make contact; ask if they would be interested in cooperation with Germany; and, if so, to send a liaison man to Germany to discuss specific plans and future co-ordination.\"\n\nPfaus's mission did not include a military component and he was not given authorisation to discuss items of an intelligence nature.  In preparation for his mission, Pfaus was to later meet with the officer in charge of Office 1 West, Abwehr II HQ- Hauptmann Friedrich Carl Marwede, codenamed \"Dr. Pfalzgraf\". On reaching Ireland, the contact Pfaus had been given was a former member of the IRA's 3rd Battalion, Liam Walsh, who was a friend and confidant of Eoin O'Duffy, and then employed at the Italian Legation.  Pfaus was unaware at the time of the meeting that the fascist Blueshirts had been ideologically hostile to the IRA, but did secure from Walsh a meeting with an IRA contact.  A meeting between Pfaus and IRA representatives took place on 13 February 1939.  Pfaus reported that those included in the meeting were Moss Twomey, the new CS. Sean Russell, and Seamus (Jim) O'Donovan. Pfaus found himself unable or unauthorized to answer all the questions of the IRA, so an arrangement to send an IRA representative to Germany for substantive talks was made. Following this meeting Russell decided to send O'Donovan, within one week, as the IRA's representative.  Bowyer Bell puts it so:\"Russell, elated by the prospect of German arms, ammunition, and money to supplement the thin stream of Clan na Gael aid, decided to entrust the mission to Seamus O'Donovan.\"\n\nThe figures involved included Eduard Hempel and \"three members of the Nazi party\" in Dublin.  The meeting took place in County Donegal and General Eoin O'Duffy, Seamus Burke, and Theodor Kordt (attached to the German embassy in London) were reportedly responsible for making the arrangements. Another meeting reportedly took place in Louisburgh, County Mayo between Hempel, O'Duffy, and members of the IRA in August 1939.\n\nSeamus O'Donovan\n\nO'Donovan, a German speaker, made three trips to Germany in 1939.  The first meeting in February saw O'Donovan conduct discussions with the head of Office 1 West, Abwehr HQFriedrich Carl Marwede, codenamed \"Dr. Pfalzgraf\".\n\nO'Donovan and Marwede discussed the appropriate wartime role of the IRA as it concerned the German Government. The Germans were adamant they could not supply immediate help for the IRA in its S-Plan campaign in Britain. Other areas of concern for the Germans were that they were unsure how the IRA intended to attack targets in Northern Ireland and how to supply arms to the group.  O'Donovan returned to Ireland with these concerns with after being given the codename \"V-Held\" (Agent Hero in German).  He returned to Germany on 26 April 1939 for more meetings with Marwede, this time to discuss radio contact, a courier route for messages and armaments, and the location of a safe house in London for use in the courier route.  By the time O'Donovan returned to Ireland on 15 May, Russell had left for the United States as part of the propaganda arm of the S-Plan and installed Stephen Hayes as Acting CS. The final meeting O'Donovan took part in was in August 1939 when he brought his wife with him. This series of meetings was also attended by Joseph McGarrity, the leader of Clan na Gael and Monty Barry, his wife and sister of the late Kevin Barry. According to O'Donovan's diaries, he was escorted to the meetings by a representative of the German Foreign Ministry.  The topics under discussion were:\n the possibility of reviving the English campaign in the event of war,\n the IRA capabilities in England, Northern Ireland, and Ireland,\n the policies, intentions and probable reactions of the Dublin government to any outbreak of hostilities between Nazi Germany and Britain,\n the standard of IRA capabilities and their exact arms requirements.\n\nO'Donovan notes in his diary that his hosts told him that there would be a war \"probably within one week.\"  A few days later, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland.\n\nCommunication problems\n\nThe radio transmitter that was supplied to the IRA by Joseph McGarrity proved to lack the range to reach Germany, and the IRA began using it for propaganda broadcasts- leading to its swift capture by the Irish authorities on 29 December 1939.  During its capture, they also found evidence of attempts at coded transmissions to Nazi Germany.  Though the transmitter had been captured, O'Donovan, up to his internment in September 1941, was to continue monitoring and transc", "instruction": " What specific type of intelligence or information was the IRA looking to obtain from the Abwehr during their meetings in Ireland in 1939 and what was their proposed method of communication?"}

{"topic": "Northwood House", "document": "Northwood House is a country manor house in Cowes on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. The current building dates back to 1799 and was built for the London businessman George Ward, remaining in his family for five generations. It is a Grade II listed building, said to have a ground floor area of around 15,000 square feet. \n\nIn 1929, Northwood House and its 26-acre \"pleasure park\", known as Northwood Park, were gifted by the Wards to Cowes Urban District Council. The gift was conditional upon the house being used as municipal offices and the grounds ‘as pleasure gardens for the people of Cowes’.\n\nIn 2010, after 81 years of operating as council offices, the council withdrew and handed the house and estate over to a charitable trust to administer. Today this Georgian manor house is looked after and run by the Northwood House Charitable Trust Co. Ltd. Their aim is to preserve the building and its grounds for the enjoyment of future generations. Its grounds are open to the public and its buildings are available to hire or to let by the general public as an events centre. This is typically for weddings, parties and conferences.\n\nCurrent usage \nThere are currently seven main rooms in the house which are available for hire for events, conferences and special occasions. These are the ball room, the dining room, the drawing room, the morning room, the library, the rotunda and the house bar. Wedding ceremonies can be held in the first six of these rooms, with the ball room being able to seat 120 people.\n\nThere are other smaller rooms available in the house to hire or to let for longer periods. There is also a converted stable block in the grounds, which is now known as The Community Hall. As well as being available for private functions, the 26-acre estate also hosts a number of public events each year and still has its original tennis courts and bowling green.\n\nThe original icehouse still remains, half buried in the grounds of Northwood House. There are thought to be about fifteen icehouses remaining on the Isle of Wight. There is also a war memorial in the grounds, dedicated to those who lost their lives in the First World War. It was originally located at the junction of the High Street and Market Hill, but was itself damaged in an air raid during the Second World War. The remains were relocated to Northwood Park and it now stands as a memorial to both wars.\n\nSurrounding the original entrance-way into the house, the tarmac area has now been converted into a pay short-stay car park, for public use.\n\nHistory \nThe Ward family held the estate through six generations from 1793 until 1929. The road which runs in front of the house is named Ward Avenue in their honour. However, they also owned a huge amount of land across the Isle of Wight and also resided at Weston Manor in Freshwater. The successive owners of the estate are as follows:\n\nThe Ward family\n\nGeorge Ward (1793–1829)\nIn 1793, George Ward esq, a highly successful merchant banker from Broad Street in the city of London, bought at auction the Cowes estate of Bellevue, which consisted of Belle Vue House and seventeen acres of land. The house was described as a 'modern brick dwelling house', with four rooms on each floor and an excellent wine cellar.  \n\nIn 1799, he largely demolished Belle Vue House and built Northwood House on its site, with the grounds being renamed to Northwood Park. The only part of Belle Vue which still exists are the large cellars underneath Northwood House, said to have been originally built to hide smuggled goods. By this time, Ward had also acquired more land in Cowes, including Debourne Farm, bringing the estate up to 217 acres. The driveway, leading up to the house, was by that time almost a mile long. The changes to the house were designed by John Nash, the famous London architect. Nash also designed Buckingham Palace as well as many other island properties, including East Cowes Castle, the IW County Club and St Mildred's Church, Whippingham.\n\nThe walls surrounding the estate were built from Bembridge limestone, taken from Brading Harbour.\n\nWard's wealth originated from his Grandfather, John Ward and his father, who was also called John Ward. Both of whom were highly successful businessmen. However, aside from this, in 1783, his father also won a half-share of a £20,000 state-run lottery win. This is worth over a million pounds today. George Ward was also the older brother of Robert Plumer Ward, the barrister, politician and novelist who was MP for Cockermouth between 1802 and 1806.\n\nAmongst other things, George Ward made his own fortune by lending money to the government during the Napoleonic Wars at highly beneficial rates of interest. He used his money to buy more and more land on the Isle of Wight, eventually amassing around 20,000 acres, said to be one fifth of the island's area. Due to the enormous amounts of land that he owned by this time, his nickname was 'King Ward'. Ward was also a director of the East India Docks in London.  \n\nIn 1798, George Ward was nominated as a new sheriff in the Court of Exchequer \n\nIn 1803, his wife Mary had a baby daughter, born at the house. However, in 1813, she died of a paralytic stroke.\n\nIn 1813, George Ward started the first paddle steamer service between Cowes and Southampton. The Isle of Wight Royal Mail Steam Packet Company would eventually become the company now known as Red Funnel.\n\nIn 1817, a duel took place at Northwood House between Major Orlando Lockyer and Lieutenant John Sutton, after Lockyer took offense to a comment made by Sutton, whilst both were drinking one night. In the morning, at the agreed duelling place, it was said that Sutton apologised and informed Lockyer that he would not return fire against him. Lockyer still asked for the signal to fire and when the handkerchief was dropped, shot Sutton through the heart without Sutton even unstopping his pistol. Before dying, Sutton staggered forward and held out his hand, which Lockyer took. Lockyer and his seconds then fled the scene. At the Coroner's inquest, the jury returned a verdict of 'Wilful Murder' against Lockyer and his two seconds, who at that time had still not been apprehended.  In their subsequent trial at the Winchester Assizes, they were charged with murder. Lockyer said that he had been under the most gross provocation and that he had asked for Sutton to make a concession which would make the duel unnecessary, but that Sutton refused and was obstinate to the last. The defendants were found guilty of manslaughter and given three months' imprisonment each. John Sutton is buried in the next door St Mary's Church graveyard.\n\nIn 1821, to celebrate the coronation of George IV, a grand celebration for the poor people of Northwood and Cowes was held at Northwood House. A feast for 2,000 people was prepared and it was seen as an opportunity for them to testify their loyalty and joy to the new king. As well as giving use of his estate, Ward donated 50 guineas towards the total cost of 200 guineas, for the food and the entertainment.\n\nIn 1823, Ward was commended for his 'munificent' generosity in distributing six bullocks and ten chaldrons of coals amongst the 'poor and deserving objects' of Cowes.\n\nGeorge had a famous and talented son, the cricketer William Ward. Following in the family footsteps, William was also a noted financier. But as a cricketer, he scored the first-ever first-class double-century and his score of 278 for the MCC v Norfolk in 1820, remained the highest ever first-class score for 56 years, until it was finally beaten by W. G. Grace in 1876, with a score of 344. The ball that Ward played with is held in the MCC Museum and is thought to be the oldest in existence.\n\nWilliam Ward can also be thanked for saving the famous Lord's cricket ground from being sold to a housing developer in 1825. He stepped in and bought the lease, to prevent this from happening. In 1817, William was elected as a director of the Bank of England and was an expert on foreign exchanges.

Only one was built.\n\nDesign and development\n\nThe Potez 38 was a monoplane with high wings built around wooden box spars, spruce ribs and with fabric covering. In plan the wings were rectangular out to rounded tips and they were braced to the lower fuselage longerons with streamlined V-form struts on each side. There was 3° of dihedral.\n\nThe rectangular section fuselage was built in three parts, all with tubular metal structures though of different geometries.  The front and rear sections were metal covered but the central section containing the cabin was covered in plywood. The forward section contained a  Hispano-Suiza 12Lbr water cooled V-12 engine, driving a two bladed propeller and with its radiator near the rear of the engine on the fuselage underside. There were two  fuel tanks, one in each wing, and an oil tank aft of the engine fire-wall. The cockpit had low profile glazing with a windscreen of V-plan and side-by-side seating.  The Potez 38 was normally flown from the lefthand seat but dual control could be added to the other.  The cabin had a volume of  and contained eight or nine seats and a toilet and baggage compartment. It was lit by a long, continuous window on each side and accessed by port and starboard doors at the back.  The rear section of the fuselage carried a conventional tail which was wood framed and ply covered.  The fin was triangular and mounted a balanced, curved edge rudder which reached down to the keel. The straight edged tailplane, strut braced to the lower fuselage, was mounted on the fin just above its base. Inset elevators gave its trailing edge an elliptical shape.\n\nThe Potez 38 had a conventional tail-skid undercarriage, fitted with brakes.  Its main wheels were on legs mounted near the wing root just behind the leading edge, containing rubber shock absorbers and spread outwards to provide a wide track. The axles were each hinged to the lower fuselage on  V-struts with one end further forward and one in line with the legs.\n\nThe Potez 38 first flew in late 1929 or 1930.  By the end of November 1930 it had successfully completed its acceptance trials. During these it achieved a speed of   After that there are few, if any, records of its activity.\n\nSpecifications\n\nReferences\n\n1930s French civil aircraft\n038\nHigh-wing aircraft\nSingle-engined tractor aircraft\nAircraft first flown in 1930", "instruction": " What were the specific dimensions (length, wingspan, height) of the Potez 38 aircraft?"}

{"topic": "Blondie (film series)", "document": "The Blondie film series is an American comedy film series based on the comic strip of the same name, created by Chic Young. The series featured Penny Singleton as Blondie Bumstead and Arthur Lake as Dagwood Bumstead. Concurrently the film adventures were continued, with the same cast reprising their roles, in the Blondie radio series.\n\nColumbia Pictures produced the films from 1938 to 1943, and popular demand brought them back in 1945. Columbia later reissued the Blondie features, beginning with the first film in the series.\n\nColumbia used the series to showcase many of its contract players. Rita Hayworth was featured in Blondie on a Budget; Glenn Ford in Blondie Plays Cupid, Larry Parks and Janet Blair in Blondie Goes to College, Shemp Howard in Blondie Knows Best, and Adele Jergens in Blondie's Anniversary. Other roles were taken by Columbia contractees Doris Houck, Bruce Bennett, Lloyd Bridges, Ann Doran, Stanley Brown, Richard Fiske, Bud Jamison, Eddie Laughton, John Tyrrell, Alyn Lockwood, Jimmy Lloyd, Gay Nelson, and Ross Ford.\n\nFaithfulness to the comic strip was a major concern of the creators of the movie series.  Little touches were added that were iconic to the strip, like the appearance of Dagwood's famous sandwiches - and the running gag of Dagwood colliding with the mailman amid a flurry of letters, (which preceded the title sequence in almost every film).  The films were typical of family-fare situational comedies of the period, and are endearingly funny in a low-key way. As the series progressed, the Bumstead children grew from toddlers to young adults onscreen.  Larry Simms as Baby Dumpling (later known as Alexander) reprised his role in all the films.  Daughter Cookie was played by three different child actresses, beginning in 1942 with her first appearance (as an infant) in Blondie's Blessed Event, the eleventh entry in the series.  Daisy had pups in the twelfth episode, Blondie for Victory (1942).  Rounding out the regular supporting cast, character actor Jonathan Hale played Dagwood's irascible boss, J.C. Dithers.  The Bumsteads' neighbors, the Woodleys, were oddly missing from the series.  The Woodleys were in the last film, Beware of Blondie.\n\nFilms\nTwenty-eight films were produced by Columbia Pictures between 1938 and 1950:\n\n Blondie (1938)\n Blondie Meets the Boss (1939)\n Blondie Takes a Vacation (1939)\n Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939)\n Blondie on a Budget (1940)\n Blondie Has Servant Trouble (1940)\n Blondie Plays Cupid (1940)\n Blondie Goes Latin (1941)\n Blondie in Society (1941)\n Blondie Goes to College (1942)\n Blondie's Blessed Event (1942)\n Blondie for Victory (1942)\n It's a Great Life (1943)\n Footlight Glamour (1943)\n Leave It to Blondie (1945)\n Life with Blondie (1945)\n Blondie's Lucky Day (1946)\n Blondie Knows Best (1946)\n Blondie's Big Moment (1947)\n Blondie's Holiday (1947)\n Blondie in the Dough (1947)\n Blondie's Anniversary (1947)\n Blondie's Reward (1948)\n Blondie's Secret (1948)\n Blondie's Big Deal (1949)\n Blondie Hits the Jackpot (1949)\n Blondie's Hero (1950)\n Beware of Blondie (1950)\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Blondie Goes to Hollywood, by Carol Lynn Scherling.

{"topic": "Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here", "document": "Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here is a 1969 American Western film based on the true story of a Chemehuevi–Paiute Native American named Willie Boy and his run-in with the law in 1909 in Banning, California, United States. \nThe film is an adaptation of the 1960 book Willie Boy: A Desert Manhunt by Harry Lawton.\n\nThe film was written and directed by the once blacklisted Abraham Polonsky, who, due to his blacklisting, had not directed a film since Force of Evil in 1948.\n\nPlot\nThe film's story revolves around the Paiute Native American outlaw Willie Boy (Robert Blake), who escapes with his lover, Lola (Katharine Ross), after killing her father in self defense. According to tribal custom Willie can then claim Lola as his wife. According to the law, Deputy Sheriff Cooper (Robert Redford) is required to charge him with murder.\n\nWillie Boy and Lola are hunted for several days by a posse led by Cooper. Cooper is forced to turn back to work security for President Taft. Willie manages to repel the posse's advance when he ambushes them from the top of Ruby Mountain. He only tries to shoot their horses, but ends up accidentally killing a bounty hunter, resulting in another murder charge.\n\nDays later, as the posse closes in, Lola dies by a gunshot wound to the chest. It is left deliberately ambiguous whether Lola shot herself so that she wouldn't slow Willie down or whether Willie killed her to keep her out of the posse's hands. Cooper is inclined to believe the latter and then goes off ahead of the posse to bring in Willie dead or alive. As soon as Cooper catches up, he comes under fire from Willie, who is positioned at the top of Ruby Mountain. Cooper narrowly avoids being shot on several occasions.\n\nIn the film's climax, Cooper maneuvers behind Willie, who has donned a ghost shirt, and tells him he can turn around if he wants to, which he does. The two pause before Willie raises his rifle at Cooper, who beats him to the draw and shoots him. Fatally struck in the chest, Willie tumbles down the hillside. Cooper picks up Willie's gun and finds that it wasn't even loaded, making it apparent that Willie deliberately chose death over capture. Abashed, Cooper carries the slain outlaw the rest of the way down Ruby Mountain and delivers him to other Paiutes, who carry the corpse away and burn the remains.\n\nWhen confronted by the county sheriff, Cooper is told that the burning of Willie's body will ruin the people's chance to see Willie in the (now-dead) flesh, denying them the ability \"to see something\". Cooper retorts:  \"Tell them we're all out of souvenirs\".\n\nCast\n Robert Redford as Cooper\n Katharine Ross as Lola\n Robert Blake as Willie \n Susan Clark as Liz\n Barry Sullivan as Calvert\n John Vernon as Hacker\n Charles Aidman as Benby\n Charles McGraw as Wilson\n Shelly Novack as Finney\n Robert Lipton as Newcombe\n Lloyd Gough as Dexter\n Ned Romero as Tom\n John Wheeler as Newman \n Erik Holland as Digger (as Eric Holland)\n Garry Walberg as Dr. Mills\n Jerry Velasco as Chino\n George Tyne as Le Marie\n Lee de Broux as Meathead (as Lee De Broux)\n Wayne Sutherlin as Harry\n Jerome Raphael as Salesman (as Jerome Raphel)\n Lou Frizzell as Station Agent\n\nHistory\nAs depicted in the movie, Willie Boy and Lola (her actual name was Carlota, though she was also called Isoleta and Lolita in various accounts) did run through the Morongo Valley. Carlota was found shot in the back in an area known as The Pipes in northwest Yucca Valley. Willie Boy was blamed for her death, but a 1994 book detailing Carlota's autopsy proved that the bullet had been shot from a long distance away, implicating the posse. Willie Boy did ambush the posse at Ruby Mountain, killing several horses and accidentally wounding a posse member. He ended his 'last stand' by suicide on the flanks of Ruby Mountain west of the current site of Landers, California.\n\nWillie Boy's grave monument can be found at . The monument itself bears the inscription “The West’s Last Famous Manhunt”, alluding to the notion that this was the last effort of its type before the use of a posse was generally replaced by modern, 'fully' staffed and empowered law enforcement agencies.\n\nAwards\n\nSee also\n List of American films of 1969\n Gilman Ranch\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Pictures of Willie Boy's monument and a map to the monument location\n\n1969 films\n1969 Western (genre) films\nAmerican Western (genre) films\n1960s English-language films\n1960s chase films\nFilms about Native Americans\nFilms based on non-fiction books\nFilms set in Riverside County, California\nFilms shot in California\nBanning, California\nUniversal Pictures films\nFilms scored by Dave Grusin\nRevisionist Western (genre) films\n1960s American films", "instruction": " What were the reasons behind Willie Boy's decision to commit suicide instead of surrendering to Deputy Sheriff Cooper?"}

{"topic": "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (soundtrack)", "document": "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack to the 2007 film of the same name, based on the book by J. K. Rowling. Nicholas Hooper composed the film's score, following John Williams, who scored the first three films, and Patrick Doyle, who did the fourth. Though new to the series, Hooper had worked with director David Yates before. The soundtrack was released 10 July 2007, the day before the film's release.\n\nDevelopment\nHooper incorporated \"Hedwig's Theme\", the series' theme originally written by John Williams for the first film and heard in all subsequent entries, into the score. In March and April 2007, Hooper, conductor Alastair King and the Chamber Orchestra of London recorded nearly two hours of music at Abbey Road Studios in London with orchestrations provided by King, Geoff Alexander, Julian Kershaw, Bradley Miles and Simon Whiteside. Two new main themes were made to reflect the new character Dolores Umbridge and Lord Voldemort's invasion of Harry's mind. A Japanese Taiko drum was used for a deeper sound in the percussion. The trailer contains a track by X-Ray Dog, entitled \"Divine Crusade\", which first appeared on the album K-9 Empire before being licensed to Order of the Phoenix.\n\nHooper said he reviewed the previous soundtracks of the Harry Potter films by John Williams, particularly the third soundtrack, but ultimately \"decided that it was best if I moved into my own way of composing rather than trying to emulate John Williams, which is impossible.\"\n\nRelease\nThe soundtrack was also released in a special edition, with a custom hinged box with Navy velveteen fabric. Inside the box is a 20-page booklet with a foil-embossed front cover.\n\nReception\nCritical reaction to the score was fairly mixed compared to the previous four scores in the series.  Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks awarding the score three stars out of five, saying \"...it fails to provide continuity within either its own confines or those of the franchise as a whole\".  Archie Watt of MovieCues said \"This isn’t a bad score by any means, but there can be little argument that it is the weakest of all the Harry Potter scores to date\".\n\nChart performance\nThe soundtrack debuted at number 43 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 16,000 copies in its first week and has since sold a total of 356,000 copies in U.S. and a million copies worldwide. The soundtrack also charted at five on the Top Soundtracks Chart.\n\nTrack listing\n\n \"Dumbledore's Army\" was used in the Quidditch trials scene in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\n \"Another Story\", \"Hall of Prophecy\", \"The Room of Requirement\", and \"A Journey to Hogwarts\" contain samples of \"Hedwig's Theme\" written by John Williams.\n \"The Kiss\" was heard in the viaduct scene during the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n05\n2007 soundtrack albums\n2000s film soundtrack albums\nFantasy film soundtracks", "instruction": " What are some specific ways in which Nicholas Hooper differentiated his compositions from those of John Williams in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix?"}

{"topic": "One Mic", "document": "\"One Mic\" is a song by American rapper Nas, released April 16, 2002 on Columbia Records and distributed through Ill Will Records in the United States. It was issued as the third single from his fifth studio album, Stillmatic (2001). The single peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Nas's third top-fifty hit on the chart.\n\nMusic and production \nProduction for \"One Mic\" was handled by Nas and hip hop producer Chucky Thompson. Talking about the inspiration for the song, Nas stated: \"I'm a huge fan of Phil Collins and I just wanted to take the vibe from 'In the Air Tonight'.\" Steve Juon of RapReviews wrote that the song features a production technique previously implemented by such hip hop artists as Outkast and the Roots, which he described as \"a quiet groove that steadily increases in energy and intensity until an increasingly amped Nas lets his lyrical rage boil over like a Final Fantasy fighter smacked ONCE too often.\" According to Nick Butler, the song's structure \"slowly build[s] up from a simple 'In the Air Tonight' sample toward the full production ... like hearing two mini hip-hop versions of 'Stairway to Heaven', before Nas flips the script for the third verse and does the same thing in reverse.\"\n\nAccording to Juon, the final verse has a reversal of this formula, in which Nas \"goes from amped up to soft-spoken, drawing you even closer into his rap.\" \"One Mic\" begins with a slow, deliberate flow and beat. Music critic Brett Berliner wrote \"'One Mic' starts out with a slow beat reminiscent of a crappy R&B song. Throughout the song, Nas' lazy flow turns into an angry rant over a fast paced beat, and finally a siren.\"\n\nLyrics and themes \nThe lyrics of \"One Mic\" discuss Nas's desire for a simple life (\"Only if I had one gun, one girl, and one crib/One God to show me how to do things his son did\") and obstacles that prevent it (\"[if] One ni**ga front, my face on the front page\"), and a lifestyle in which Nas proclaims \"All I need is one mic - fuck the cars, the jewelry\". It has been noted by music writers for its political consciousness and dystopian themes. Keith Harris of City Pages described the lyrical structure of \"One Mic\" as \"urban claustrophobia distilled and digitized, with Nas's reportorial eye zooming in on a detail, then pulling back to a panoramic overview.\" Music critic Cynthia Fuchs described the song's lyrical scheme as \"building slowly to a crescendo of declaration and rage, then coming back, to seek a way to make a difference, with that precious one mic.\"\n\nIn an interview for Rolling Stone, Nas discussed the theme of the song, stating \"'One Mic' is just about the power. It's almost like Hip Hop is Dead in its infant stages, saying how much this is a blessing to be out here, speaking about what's happening in my neighborhood, having the whole world understand and relate.\" He also referred to commentator Bill O'Reilly's criticism of \"Shoot 'Em Up\", a song from Nas's fourth album Nastradamus (1999), as he stated \"If I didn't have a microphone, I could never talk about 'Shoot 'Em Up', and I was talking about Queens, New York, being shot up. What do I have to do to get somebody to turn around and hear what I'm saying and take it serious? I'm not here just to be in your face talking nonsense, we're talking about reality. For him to be upset or people like him to be upset is insane to me. It just shows how ignorant people are.\" In the interview, Nas continued to discuss his inspiration and the song's lyrical theme, stating:\n\nIn the song, Nas also asks God to forgive him for his sins. In the hip hop book Beats, Rhymes & Life (2007), music writer Ytasha Womack compared Nas's lyrics on \"One Mic\" to the work of rapper Tupac Shakur, analyzing it as a song with strong religious, Christian overtones and lyrical themes. Womack wrote that \"Nas's references ultimately humanized Jesus, with attempts to show direct parallels between our quest and that of the Wayshower.\" Womack concluded with analyzing the incorporation of religious themes by Nas in his composition, stating \"Nas clung to spiritual questioning, expressing a desire to be like the early mystics, in order to possess their knowledge and powers. While he expresses that he has the potential of the greats, in 'One Mic' he asks God to show him how to do things his son did. Nas intertwined his day–to–day life and decisions with the pressures felt by Jesus and others, doing so almost as a means to somehow transfer their spiritual gifts to himself.\"\n\nRelease and reception\nWhen \"One Mic\" was released as a single, it entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 79 on April 20, 2002, ultimately peaking at number 43. On June 8, it debuted on the Hot Rap Tracks chart at number 9, before eventually reaching number 7. The single also peaked on the Hot Rap Singles at number 23,</ref> the Rhythmic Top 40 at number 32, and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks at number 14. A remix of \"One Mic\", featuring a sample of Mtume's \"Juicy Fruit\" (1983), was later released on the remix album From Illmatic to Stillmatic: The Remixes (2002).\n\n\"One Mic\" was well received by critics, some of whom hailed it as a \"classic\". Marc L. Hill from PopMatters cited it as Stillmatics \"standout track\", calling Nas \"our magnificently human rap god.\" Exclaim! magazine's Del F. Cowie described \"One Mic\" as the album's \"centrepiece epic\", while Butler cited \"One Mic\" as \"the best rap song of this decade\". Writing for Sputnikmusic, he said the song \"blew me away on first listen, and it's still having the same effect now. Not many rap songs can send chills up my spine. This is one of them.\" Brett Berliner from Stylus Magazine was particularly favorable of the song's use of a siren, as he called the concept \"truly incredible, and one of the best ideas for a song I’ve ever heard in my life.\" Steven Potter of the Journal Sentinel called the song a \"testament to the lyrical skill only the best emcees possess.\" Yahoo! Music's James Poletti felt it was \"some of the best hip-hop recorded\" in 2002. Kathryn McGuire from Rolling Stone was more critical, writing that \"the hyperbolic urgency of 'One Mic' feels staged.\"\n\nIn retrospect, IGN's Jon Robinson viewed \"One Mic\" as a comeback for Nas, writing that it \"proved that he was still not only one of the dopest MCs in the world, but possibly the most gifted writer of the rap community.\" According to Juon, the song signalled a return for Nas to his early musical roots, stating \"you know that the rapper we all once called Nasty Nas has truly returned.\" In 2005, \"One Mic\" was ranked number 54 on About.com's list of the 100 Greatest Rap Songs.\n\nMusic video\nA music video for \"One Mic\" was directed by Chris Robinson and released on December 17, 2001, receiving heavy rotation on MTV, and 2002 MTV Video Music Award nominations for Best Rap Video and Video of the Year. Robinson said in an interview with MTV that he wanted to feature references to the 1976 Soweto uprising in a music video, ultimately persuading Nas to include it in the video for the song. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the video's production ran into difficulties due to the restrictions on international travel. The scene in the video of the riots was instead filmed in Los Angeles with participants from a local inner-city baseball team playing the rioters. The scene of the rock being thrown in the direction of the camera was taken over 10 times (the actor \"had a bit of a curve on his throwing arm,\" according to Robinson) before post-production work managed to complete the desired effect. Robinson also told his director of photography to open and close the shutters of the camera in the apartment scene, creating an effect", "instruction": " What significant historical events were depicted in the music video for \"One Mic\"?"}

{"topic": "Lucien Falize", "document": "Lucien Falize (Paris 4 August 1839 – Paris 4 September 1897) was a French jeweller and writer in France who was responsible for pioneering and driving the Art Nouveau movement with his firm, Falize. He is known for his breathtaking and innovative designs for both public and private sales.\n\nEarly years \nLucien was a serious and diligent child who planned to attend the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures before his father, Alexis, announced he was to become a future partner in his relatively young firm, Falize. In 1856, Lucien began an apprenticeship with his father, where he quickly learnt enough to supervise the design and manufacture of the pieces created in the workshop. His studies continued quickly, as Lucien found his passion, and in 1869 at the exhibition held by the Union Centrale des Beaux Arts appliqués à l’Industrie, he was awarded a first class medal as a coopérateur. Two years later, at the age of 32, he was made a full partner and took over the firm in 1876.\n\nMarriage and children \nThe same year he was made a partner, Lucien married Louise Clémentine Poulard (1850–1914), with whom he had three sons: André Alexis Eugène (1872–1936), Jean Henri Lucien (1874–1948), and Pierre Isidore (1875–1953). Although there is little evidence of tenderness and passion between Lucien and Clémentine – it is thought his parents instigated the match – he was a devoted father, designing and making individual silver watches for each of his children's first communion.\n\nArtistic career \n\nLucien Falize was heavily influenced by his visits to London in 1861 and 1862, where he went to the National Gallery, Westminster Abbey, and the Crystal Palace. He was struck by the Chinese, Indian, Assyrian, and Egyptian exhibits, and at the International Exhibition he was impressed by the Oriental lacquers, enamels, bronzes, prints, and earthenware taken from the collection of Sir Rutherford Alcock.\n\nDue to his ties to the firm, Falize was unable to travel to Japan, but his passion for the East began to manifest through his designs. Pendants, bracelets, necklaces, and brooches with a distinct Oriental effect began to emerge. These were enamelled and filled with bold, opaque colours with delicate scenes of nature and animals. Lucien also visited the Campana collection at the Louvre, where he viewed a number of items, being influenced by the treasure trove of medieval, Renaissance, Assyrian, Egyptian, and Byzantine objects.\n\nUntil his death by a stroke in 1897, Lucien continued to create breathtaking designs for public sale and private commissions. He was determined to make the jewellery house Falize a commercial success, collaborating with other established designers like Germain Bapst, with whom he was partnered from 1880 to 1892. He was a prolific writer and reviewer and often published under his pseudonym, ‘Monsieur Josse’ in the decorative arts journals of the day.\n\nLucien Falize was also deeply involved in the Union Centrale throughout his career. He firmly believed in the importance of providing proper training to future designers, and he submitted plans for technical exhibitions and donated working prototypes of chatelaines and electrotypes of bracelets. Lucien also entered his firm into a number of competitions and Expositions Universelles and was awarded countless honours and honorary positions throughout his career.\n\nOften frustrated by the need to be a commercial success as well as a critical one, Lucien said in a letter to his son André in April 1896 “a big firm cannot survive on works of art alone.”\n\nHis friend, jeweller and collector Henri Vever, said about Lucien:  How he would have loved to have lived…at the time of the Medici, freed from heavy commercial burdens and only preoccupied by the creation of beautiful works.\n\nExhibitions and awards \n1869: Union Centrale des Beaux arts appliqués à l’Industrie\nAwarded a first class medal as a coopérateur\n\n1876: Union Centrale des Beaux arts appliqués à l’Industrie\nAs he was a jury member and official reporter, Lucien was excluded from the awards\n\n1877: Amsterdam Exhibition\nRepresented France with Alfred Darcel\n\n1878: Exposition Universelle, Paris\nAwarded a Grand Prix; granted a Legion d’Honneur\n\n1880: ‘Les Arts du Métal’ at the Union Centrale\n\n1889: Exposition Universelle, Paris\nOfficial reporter on the goldsmith’s section, and was therefore unable to be awarded any prizes. \nReceived public recognition by being decorated Officer de la Légion d’Honneur\n\n1896: Salon des Champs-Elysées\n  Lucien’s gold enamelled ‘hanap’ (lidded goblet) hailed as a technical masterpiece\n\nCommissions \nAlfred Morrison (1821 – 1897): second son of James Morrison (founder of firm Morrison, Dillon & Co which was to become the Fore Street Limited Liability Company)\nGaston de Galard de Béarn, Prince de Viana (1840 – 1893): one of Lucien's most eminent patrons\nThe Pereire brothers: Emile and Isaac, prominent property developers and financiers\nLa Marquise Arconati-Visconti (1840 – 1923): daughter of Alphonse Peyrat\nEduord Corroyer (1837 – 1904): architect and pupil of Viollet-le-Duc\nPrincess Loetitia Bonaparte: great-niece of Napoleon I\nTsar Nicholas II (1868 – 1918) and his wife, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (1872 – 1918)\nQueen Marie (1875 – 1938) and King Ferdinand I (1865 – 1927) of Romania\nPrince Alfred (1844 – 1900), Duke of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha: son of Queen Victoria\nSeveral sporting clubs in France enlisted Falize in creating sculptures, barometers, and clocks: The Jockey Club, the Société du Yacht-Club, Société des Steeple-Chases\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nFrench jewellers\n19th-century French people\n1839 births\n1897 deaths", "instruction": " What specific Eastern influences can be identified in Lucien Falize's Oriental-style jewellery designs?"}

She attracted significant attention due to her controversial interracial marriages to two Peranakan Chinese magnates, Lauw Tek Lok, Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi and Sim Keng Koen, Kapitein der Chinezen of Sukabumi.

Her first husband, Lauw Tek Lok, was a prominent and wealthy landlord who served as the Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi for 28 years from 1854 until his death in 1882. The couple had five children: Christian Tjeng Soey Lauw-Zecha, Maximiliaan Theodoor Tjeng Kiet Lauw-Zecha, Louis Tjeng Bie Lauw-Zecha, Emilia Joe Nio Lauw-Zecha and Cornelia Sebastiana Gobang Nio Lauw-Zecha.\n\nAfter her first husband's death, Zecha married his former private secretary, Sim Keng Koen, who – after his secretarial employment – had carved out a successful bureaucratic career, having been appointed Luitenant der Chinezen of the Kong Koan (Chinese Council) of Batavia in 1880. They had four children: Sim Tjeng Bouw, Betsy Lembor Nio Sim-Zecha, Piet Tjeng Ho Sim-Zecha and Chester Tjeng Soan Lauw-Sim-Zecha. Zecha's second husband was promoted to the rank of Kapitein in 1887, and kept his post until 1889.\n\nIn 1892, with the couple having settled in Sukabumi, West Java, the former Kapitein Sim Keng Koen was appointed the first Hoofd der Chinezen of Sukabumi with the rank of Kapitein-titulair der Chinezen. According to the sociologist Mely G. Tan, the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family lived as Sukabumi's premier Chinese family; Tan attributes a great part of the Kapitein's high profile and influence to Zecha's personality.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, in the face of a violent uprising in Tamboen and in the absence of any Dutch military response, Zecha showed great personal courage. Accompanied by her husband, she rode on horseback to meet directly with the insurgents, whom she addressed in person and talked into surrendering. Zecha subsequently rode on her own to Meester Cornelis to notify the authorities of the surrender, and that no military action was needed.\n\nShe was well known for her philanthropy. In 1916, she initiated the installation of a statue of the god Kongco Han Tan Kong at Sukabumi's main Chinese temple, Wihara Widhi Sakti, in order to provide a moral inspiration to the town's Chinese community during an ongoing and persistent cholera epidemic. She also spearheaded more practical measures to address the epidemic at her own expense: she personally led a team of hundreds to prepare ammonia drinks, and had the Great Post Road and the road to Pelabuhan Ratu disinfected with oil. Zecha also raised funds and supplies for outbreaks of famines in China in the early twentieth century, for which she was honoured by the Qing Dynasty authorities.\n\nZecha died in 1939. The historian Theodore Friend relates: 'When the grand dame was dying, she had a gramophone put on the table next to her bed and ordered \"You don't cry, you play me my favorite Viennese waltzes.\" Her family kept her body in state over ice for weeks, until friends from all over the world could come to final services.'\n\nZecha's descendants from both of her marriages have maintained their prominence, despite the Revolution of 1945-1950, in Indonesia and the region to this day. Her great-grandson, the hotelier Adrian Lauw-Zecha, is the founder of Aman Resorts, while her granddaughter, the ballerina Che Engku Chesterina, is a princess by marriage of Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia.\n\nReferences\n\n1848 births\n1939 deaths\nLauw-Sim-Zecha family\nCabang Atas\nIndonesian people of Czech descent\nIndo people\nPeople from Batavia, Dutch East Indies", "instruction": " What specific actions did Louisa Zecha take during the Tamboen uprising to help bring about the insurgents' surrender?"}

Their styles varied from realistic representation to the imagined.\n\nThe Early California artists helped shape and create California in culture and politics. Some were members of early survey expeditions of the West, such as Thomas Ayres and Albert Bierstadt.  Their eyes, via their art, were the eyes through which the Easterners saw and imagined California and 'The West,' from the renowned early California artists Thomas Hill, William Keith, and Thomas Moran to the populist John Englehart.\n\nEarly art advocacy\nTheir scenic paintings moved U.S. leaders in Washington, D.C., including President Abraham Lincoln. Their visual examples helped define how the United States managed and legislated the territory and then new U.S. state of California, especially represented by the preservation of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove.  \n\nThe American artist helped mold the American West by instilling and fanning the eastern population's desire to create an entirely new endeavor,  the protection of huge swaths of natural land as parks for use and enjoyment by the public. \n\nTheir legacy includes the National Park Service that formed for conservation and the people's benefit, something new in world history. President Abraham Lincoln began the system on June 30, 1864 upon signing The Yosemite Grant, giving California a state park for \"public use, resort and recreation\".\n\nPopulist art of Yosemite helped create and save Yosemite from many attempts at development. \"Celebration of Nature\" Journalists, Painters and Musicians, formed the Bohemian Club in 1872, and then recruited powerful businessmen and entrepreneurs.

But John Muir and his artist friends were not able to save Hetch Hetchy Valley, which Muir felt was more stunning than Yosemite.\n\nThis frontier was only seen through the eyes of an artist by the average easterner. And the few easterners that had seen it, took back paintings and prose of its breathtaking beauties to evangelize their family and friends on the beauties of the unspoiled west.\n\nThe artists were considered to \"advertise\" the Wonders of Nature, in a way that caused a groundswell of public opinion to protect the most visually stunning areas like Yosemite from development.\n\nSome Early California Artists\nThomas Ayres\nAlbert Bierstadt\nJohn Englehart\nThomas Hill\nGeorge Inness\nWilliam Keith\nVictor Matson\nThomas Moran\n\nDistribution\nExamples of early Californian art can be seen at the following museums.\nOakland Museum of California\nCrocker Art Museum\nThe Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens\nSociety of California Pioneers Museum \nStanford University Museum of Art\n\nReferences\n\n Early\n Early\n\nCultural history of California\nCalifornia-related lists\nLists of American artists", "instruction": " What were some specific techniques or themes commonly used by Early California artists to depict the unique landscapes and natural beauty of California?"}

{"topic": "William Thomas White", "document": "Sir William Thomas White, GCMG, PC (UK), PC (Can) (November 13, 1866February 11, 1955), was a Canadian politician and Cabinet minister. He served as minister of finance from 1911 to 1919 under Prime Minister Robert Borden. As finance minister, White introduced the income tax to help fund Canada's World War I efforts.\n\nEarly life \n\nWhite worked as a reporter for the Toronto Evening Telegram in 1890, and subsequently worked for Toronto's Assessment Department. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1895, and a law degree from Osgoode Law School in 1899.  \n\nWhite did not practice law after his graduation, but instead worked as a Managing Director for the National Trust Company, Ltd., becoming its Vice-President in 1911. National Trust was incorporated in 1898 by Senator George Albertus Cox and Edward Rogers Wood. National Trust Company, Ltd. became part of Bank of Nova Scotia as Scotia Trust in 1997.\n\nPolitical career and finance minister \n\nWhite was initially a Liberal party member, but his views diverged from the party's policies on some key matters. He was a supporter of British imperialism, and joined Clifford Sifton and other Liberals in signing an anti - reciprocity manifesto in 1911.\n\nAlthough he had few allies in the Conservative Party, White was respected by party leader Robert Borden, who recognized that White's presence would bring some disaffected Liberals to the party. After winning the general election of 1911, Borden appointed White as his Minister of Finance.  White did not hold a seat in the House of Commons of Canada at the time, and in fact had never campaigned for public office before.  Nevertheless, he was elected by acclamation in a by-election in the eastern Ontario riding of Leeds, after another Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) was convinced to resign.\n\nWhite was responsible for managing Canada's finances during World War I.  His approach was conservative, and he was reluctant to interfere with private enterprise or even to raise taxes in the early period of the war.  Although he eventually made some interventions (including fixed profit margins and regulated food supplies), he continued to reject fundamental changes in the nation's finances. One exception was the introduction in 1917 of an income tax of 4% on all income of single men over $2,000; for Canadians with annual incomes of more than $6,000, the tax rate ranged from 2 to 25 per cent. Though it was intended as a temporary war measure and despite White's recommendation that \"a year or two after the war is over, the measure should be reviewed by the minister of finance of the day, with a view of judging whether it is suitable to the conditions which then prevail,\" income tax became a permanent feature of Canadian life.\n\nIn 1919, he approved the use of naval warships to suppress post-war labour radicalism in British Columbia. White served as Finance Minister until August 1, 1919. From November 1918 to May 1919, he also served as Acting Prime Minister while Borden was in Europe.  Several members of Borden's Unionist government (a wartime coalition of the Conservative Party and some Liberals) called on White to replace Borden as Prime Minister in 1920, but he declined.\n\nIn the 1920 New Year Honours, as a reward for his service as Acting Prime Minister, White was appointed to the Imperial Privy Council, allowing him to use the honorific \"The Right Honourable\". He remained a Member of Parliament until the 1921 election when he retired from politics.  Later in the year, he published a pamphlet entitled The Story of Canada's War Finances, defending his management of the wartime economy.\n\nLater life \n\nWhite did not consider himself as a \"career politician\". His tenure as Finance Minister was very stressful, and he seems to have welcomed the opportunity to leave political life after the war's end. There is no indication that he entertained a return to politics in later years.\n\nIn 1933, he served as a member of the Royal Commission on Banking and Currency. He opposed the creation of the Bank of Canada.\n\nArchives \nThere is a Sir William Thomas White fonds at Library and Archives Canada.\n\nFootnotes\n\nExternal links \n \n\n1866 births\n1955 deaths\nCanadian Ministers of Finance\nConservative Party of Canada (1867–1942) MPs\nCanadian Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George\nMembers of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario\nCanadian members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom\nMembers of the King's Privy Council for Canada\nLawyers in Ontario\nUniversity of Toronto alumni", "instruction": " What were the specific reasons that motivated White to oppose the creation of the Bank of Canada in 1933?"}

Mykola Chaban, however, found some information about a student Nikolai Mikhailovich Stasyukov at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, which is very similar with biography of the Ukrainian minister Mykola Stasyuk.\n\nAccording to Chaban, Stasyukov was born on 16 May 1885 in Yekaterinoslav. His father nobleman Mikhail Stefanovich Stasyukov was a veterinary doctor. His mother was called Yekaterina Naumovna Konoplia. Both of them were eastern Orthodox Christians. The boy was baptized on 23 May 1885 at Holy Trinity Church in Yekaterinoslav. The date of Stasyuk birth noted at the Petersburg archives was confirmed by the state archives documents of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast where survived metric books for the 1885th year.

From 18 August 1901 to 5 June 1902 Stasyuk took additional class at the school. Remarkable is that his father also graduated the school 20 years before him.

In 1861 he joined the editorial staff of the liberal Berlin National-Zeitung, of which he was head of the feuilleton and theatre critic until 1908. Along with Theodor Fontane, who became a theatre critic for the Vossische Zeitung in 1870, Frenzel was regarded by his contemporaries as Berlin's authoritative theatre critic. His influential position was unchallenged for a long time and only weakened when Gerhart Hauptmann and others were joined by Naturalism, whom Frenzel, in contrast to Fontane, condemned and fought against. His stage reviews were published under the title: Berliner Dramaturgie collected.\n\nOn Frenzel's 70th birthday in 1897 the Prussian state awarded him the title of professor. Frenzel died on 10 June 1914 at 86 in his Berlin apartment at Dessauer Straße 19 and was buried in the Invalids' Cemetery on Scharnhorststraße. The burial site no longer exists.\n\nArtistic work \nAlready in 1857 Frenzel had a drama printed (Attila, only printed as a manuscript), but for good reasons he did not follow the career of a theater poet. He opened his independent literary career in 1859 with a collection of historical essays Dichter und Frauen (\"Poets and Women\"), which was soon followed by further collections of essays and reviews, novel and novella volumes. Frenzel initially turned to the genre of the historical novel and wrote a number of narrative works, the plot of which was preferably set in the 18th century, during the period of the Enlightenment with its then predominant French education. Later, Frenzel also wrote novels from the present, in which the growing imperial capital Berlin is the main setting.\n\nTemporarily (1866-67) Frenzel was also co-editor of the Deutsches Museum founded by Robert Eduard Prutz. In 1874 he played a decisive role in founding the Deutsche Rundschau of his friend Julius Rodenberg. Many of his novels and novellas were published in this monthly, and he was also a speaker for the Berlin stage for many years. Other activities were also of importance for the literary life of Berlin in the last third of the 19th century: he was, for example,  a co-founder of the Verein Berliner Presse, an important member of the Berlin branch of the Deutsche Schillerstiftung and a sought-after speaker for various cultural events. He delivered the eulogy at Theodor Fontane's funeral in 1898.\n\nWork \nDichter und Frauen. Studies, (Hannover 1859–66, 3 vols.)\nMelusine.Novel, (Breslau 1860)\nVanitas.

{"topic": "Gareth Penn", "document": "Gareth Sewell Penn (born January 1, 1941) is an American true crime author and amateur detective known for being among the first non-journalists to write about the Zodiac Killer case.  He published a theory about the killer's motives, publicly accused a noted UC Berkeley public policy professor of the crimes, and labeled himself a one-time suspect.\n\nReviewing the 2007 David Fincher film Zodiac for the Las Vegas Weekly, Mike D'Angelo wrote, \"I think the movie erred in selecting author Robert Graysmith as its source and nominal protagonist.  Zodiac buffs know well that the true obsessive is a fellow named Gareth Penn.\"\n\nEarly life\nPenn graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) in Germanic languages and again in 1965 with a Master of Arts (MA) in Medieval Germanic languages.  He received a Master of Library Science (MLS) from U.C. Berkeley in 1971.\n\nIn 1965, Penn entered the United States Army in Berlin, Germany and received basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey.  He received artillery survey training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he became an Artillery Surveyor Instructor. He received the National Defense Service Medal and the designation of Expert Rifle Marksman. In 1967, Penn moved back to Berkeley, California, where he was transferred to the Army reserves.  He was honorably discharged in 1971.\n\nCareer\n\nWriting\nPenn's writing, mostly focused on the Zodiac case, was largely published in The Ecphorizer, the newsletter of the San Francisco chapter of Mensa International, which had a peak readership of 700 and was published between 1981 and 1995 A 1972 piece he wrote while attending UC Berkeley, Gottfried von Strassburg and the Invisible Art was published in the peer-reviewed journal of Germanic studies Colloquia Germanica. The piece is a reflection on the legend of Tristan, a 12th-century hero of Celtic folklore.\n\nPenn says his father, Hugh Scott Penn, who had been a U.S. Army cryptographer during World War II, introduced him to the Zodiac case while he was working for the California Department of Justice.\n\nPenn wrote two self-published books: Times 17: The Amazing Story of the Zodiac Murders in California and Massachusetts, 1966-1981 released in 1987; and The Second Power:  A Mathematical Analysis of the letters attributed to the Zodiac murderer and supplement to Times 17 in 1999.\n\nZodiac Killer\nGareth Penn started writing about the Zodiac case in a 1981 article for California Magazine entitled Portrait of the Artist as a Mass Murderer.\n\nIn Portrait, Penn theorized that the Zodiac crime scenes were selected by the killer in order to create a geometric shape over the surface of the San Francisco Bay Area as a sort of \"murderous art project.\" Part of Penn's commentary about that theory included the observation that, \"Other artists had sought to remove their work from the ordinary human perspective. Zodiac trumped them all.\"\n\nPenn then spent the better part of two decades publicly accusing University of California, Berkeley public policy professor Michael O'Hare of the Zodiac murders.\n\nAccusation against Michael O'Hare\nStarting around 1981, Penn began publicly accusing University of California, Berkeley public policy professor Michael O'Hare of the Zodiac murders in amateur newsletters and self-published books. Penn openly accused O'Hare on at least two occasions. The basis for these accusations was Penn's cryptographic analysis of a Zodiac letter, which he claimed yielded the name \"Mike O.\" He also accused O'Hare of the murder of Joan Webster, a graduate architecture student at Harvard who disappeared in 1981 and whose remains were found near Boston in 1990. Penn argued that a \"geometric design\" yielded similarities between the Webster murder and the Zodiac killings in California. On that basis, he accused O'Hare of murdering Webster. \nO'Hare denied being involved in any murder, and has written about his strange experience.\n\nO'Hare filed an FBI complaint against Penn and in May 1981, the Bureau investigated Penn for possible extortion. According to FBI memos, an agent \"contacted Penn by telephone and told him that if he was responsible for the correspondence to [O'Hare] he should immediately cease and desist, pointing out that it could jeopardize any investigation and he could possibly be subject to both civil and criminal penalties.\"\n\nIn a May 1981 meeting with FBI agents, Penn \"freely admitted sending material to [O'Hare] but stated he had no intent to extort anything.\n\nCryptography Blog\nPenn continues writing about the case, maintaining a narrative blog entitled D550.\n\nBooks \n “Times 17”\n “The Second Power”\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nJake Wark at This is the Zodiac Speaking website\nGareth Penn:   \n\nAmerican non-fiction crime writers\n1941 births\nLiving people\nUnited States Army soldiers\nMensans\nZodiac Killer\nPeople from Carmel-by-the-Sea, California\nAmerican conspiracy theorists", "instruction": " What evidence, aside from his cryptographic analysis, does Gareth Penn present to support his accusations against Michael O'Hare for the Zodiac murders?"}

Cameroon was a German colony at that time. At the age of four Alexander was brought to Germany for education. In the First World War, in 1915, he fought against the British and the French as a German officer at Gallipoli in Turkey, which was allied with Germany. One year before in Cameroon, his father, Rudolf Manga Bell, had been executed after a conflict with the German colonial administration on charges of high treason.\n\nIn 1919 in Hamburg Alexander Douala-Bell married Andrea Jimenez Berroa. She was the daughter of the Afro-Cuban pianist Jose Manuel Jimenez Berroa, professor at the Hamburg Music Conservatory, and Emma Mina Filter, descending of an old-established Hamburg family. They had two children, son Jose Emmanuel, born 1920, and daughter Andrea Tüke Ekedi, born 1921.\n\nLife in France and Cameroon \nCameroon became French in 1919 according to the Treaty of Versailles. The French government now forced the moving of Alexandre Douala-Bell to France, expecting this would give a benefit to the legitimacy of the new French rule in Cameroon. On the other hand, the French government distrusted him because of his German background and insisted on \"frenchifying\" him before returning to Cameroon. In mid-1919, the couple moved to Paris. After some temporary stays, Alexandre Douala-Bell returned to Cameroon in 1922, but without his wife Andrea Manga Bell and the children who remained in Europe. In the following years he had to fight for his position in Cameroon, as well as for his family property, around which he led an 18-year-long lawsuit.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Alexandre Douala-Bell fought on the side of France and enlisted in Dakar to the French army. In the post-war period, all French colonial territories could send MPs to Paris. Alexandre Douala-Bell was elected to the Constituent Assembly of the Fourth Republic in 1945 as one of the representatives of Cameroon. In the parliamentary elections of 1946 he scored almost a two-thirds majority. In 1951 and 1956 he was re-elected. From 1946 to 1955 he was a member of the MRP (Mouvement républicain populaire), in his last legislative period from 1956 until his retirement in 1958 he was one of the \"Indépendants d'outre-mer\". In 1952 he was a delegate of France at the UN General Assembly. He was also a member of the Territorial Assembly of Cameroon since 1952.\n\nDeath of the son \nDuring a visit of his son Emmanuel at Douala Alexandre shot him in a dispute on 15 September 1947. Alexandre was imprisoned, but released soon on 19 November 1947. The death of his son was classified as an accident and the French Parliament rejected the waiver of immunity. Efforts by Andrea Manga Bell, to achieve a trial despite this, were unsuccessful.\n\nIt was not until 1951 that Alexander Douala-Bell was enthroned as head of the Douala (chef supérieure). On 19 September 1966 Alexandre Douala Bell died. His successor as head of Douala was his nephew René Douala Manga Bell. .\n\nNotes \n\nCameroonian traditional rulers\nDeputies of the 1st National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic\nDeputies of the 2nd National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic\nDeputies of the 3rd National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic", "instruction": " What led to the dispute between Alexandre Douala Manga Bell and his son Jose Emmanuel that resulted in the latter's death in 1947?"}
{"topic": "Ralph A. Worley Observatory", "document": "Ralph A. Worley Observatory  is an astronomical observatory currently under lease to Shreveport-Bossier Astronomical Society. It was built in 1964 by the Shreveport-Bossier Astronomical Society and later donated to the Caddo Parish School System.  It is located 8 miles south of Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.\n\nHistory \nIn 1959 when the Worley family of Shreveport attended an astronomy convention in Colorado.  Enthusiastic about astronomy, an organizational meeting for a club was held on October 10, 1959.  The first public meeting of the club was held on November 14, 1959 at Centenary College.  Sara Worley was the first President.  At that time, the name of the club was the Shreveport Junior Astronomical Society.  Only those members under the age of 16 could vote or hold office.  Dues for regular members were $5.00 a year including a subscription to Sky and Telescope magazine. Two of the main goals of the members were to build an observatory and secure a planetarium for the Shreveport area.  Star parties were held for the public to view through telescopes in order to raise money for the observatory.  A fee of thirty cents per person was charged.  The club estimated that approximately $10,000 was needed to build an observatory and an additional $10,000 for the telescope, eyepieces, and other equipment.\n\nThe members looked for a site to build the observatory.  Land was offered by a farmer—Mr. L. S. \"Scrib\" Frierson, but it was found that the access road through the cotton field to the selected site had a small culvert which would not support a concrete truck.  Mr. Frierson directed the club members to another part of the cotton plantation where they came across an abandoned corn crib that had been burned and abandoned.  The architect, Joseph Schirer, said he could redraw the original plans to convert the corn crib into an observatory building.  Construction was started in September 1963 for the observatory that is still present.\n\nUnited Gas Pipeline Corporation designed and built the mount and drive for a 16 1/2\" telescope.  It was estimated that it would weigh between 2,000 and 3,000 pounds and was nicknamed \"The Monster.\"  The members took turns working on the grinding of the telescope mirror.  After much work by the members and companies involved, the Shreveport Observatory was dedicated and officially opened on April 18, 1964.  The estimated value was $55,000 and was 15 miles from the city of Shreveport.  Today, the observatory is less than 8 miles from the city and being encroached upon by the lights of not only the city and highway, but also lights from oil and gas wells. The Society having met its major goal of bringing an observatory to the Shreveport area went on to help promote the City of Shreveport in building a planetarium which was later funded and built by the City of Shreveport.\n\nIn 1967 Lockheed donated a solar filter to the Society.  At that time, it was said to be only one in five in use in the United States.  The members of the Society worked hard to build a building to house a telescope to be used with this filter.  The building was dedicated in 1969.\n\nThe observatory ownership was transferred to the Caddo Parish School Board in November 1969.  Today, the Society has an agreement for use of the observatory.\n\nThe club reorganized itself in April 1971 by becoming an adult club.  Younger members could be members, but only those 16 years or older could be an officer.  On March 27, 1975 the Society became the one that it is today.  Incorporation papers were signed on that day and a board of directors was created.  Later, the Society added \"Bossier\" to its name to become the Shreveport-Bossier Astronomical Society, Inc.\n\nSee also \nList of observatories\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nRalph A.

Also, while it is the closest TRAX station to Bangerter Highway (SR-154), there is no direct access to the station from Bangerter Highway either. The station can be reached from Bangerter Highway by heading east on 9000 South, then north on 3200 West, and finally west on 8660 South. The station is just northeast of the Jordan Valley Medical Center. In the early planning stages, the station was referred to as \"Bangerter Station\", but later changed to the current name. The station opened August 7, 2011, as part of the Red Line (Mid-Jordan) and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority.\n\nOriginal plans for the station included a large Park and Ride lot with 577 free (UTA exclusive) parking spaces.

{"topic": "Field (physics)", "document": "In physics, a field is a physical quantity, represented by a scalar, vector, or tensor, that has a value for each point in space and time. For example, on a weather map, the surface temperature is described by assigning a number to each point on the map; the temperature can be considered at a certain point in time or over some interval of time, to study the dynamics of temperature change. A surface wind map, assigning an arrow to each point on a map that describes the wind speed and direction at that point, is an example of a vector field, i.e. a 1-dimensional (rank-1) tensor field. Field theories, mathematical descriptions of how field values change in space and time, are ubiquitous in physics. For instance, the electric field is another rank-1 tensor field, while electrodynamics can be formulated in terms of two interacting vector fields at each point in spacetime, or as a single-rank 2-tensor field.\n\nIn the modern framework of the quantum theory of fields, even without referring to a test particle, a field occupies space, contains energy, and its presence precludes a classical \"true vacuum\". This has led physicists to consider electromagnetic fields to be a physical entity, making the field concept a supporting paradigm of the edifice of modern physics. \"The fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes it very real ... a particle makes a field, and a field acts on another particle, and the field has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can have.\" In practice, the strength of most fields diminishes with distance, eventually becoming undetectable. For instance the strength of many relevant classical fields, such as the gravitational field in Newton's theory of gravity or the electrostatic field in classical electromagnetism, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (i.e., they follow Gauss's law).\n\nA field can be classified as a scalar field, a vector field, a spinor field or a tensor field according to whether the represented physical quantity is a scalar, a vector, a spinor, or a tensor, respectively. A field has a consistent tensorial character wherever it is defined: i.e. a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field somewhere else. For example, the Newtonian gravitational field is a vector field: specifying its value at a point in spacetime requires three numbers, the components of the gravitational field vector at that point. Moreover, within each category (scalar, vector, tensor), a field can be either a classical field or a quantum field, depending on whether it is characterized by numbers or quantum operators respectively. In this theory an equivalent representation of field is a field particle, for instance a boson.\n\nHistory\nTo Isaac Newton, his law of universal gravitation simply expressed the gravitational force that acted between any pair of massive objects. When looking at the motion of many bodies all interacting with each other, such as the planets in the Solar System, dealing with the force between each pair of bodies separately rapidly becomes computationally inconvenient. In the eighteenth century, a new quantity was devised to simplify the bookkeeping of all these gravitational forces. This quantity, the gravitational field, gave at each point in space the total gravitational acceleration which would be felt by a small object at that point. This did not change the physics in any way: it did not matter if all the gravitational forces on an object were calculated individually and then added together, or if all the contributions were first added together as a gravitational field and then applied to an object.\n\nThe development of the independent concept of a field truly began in the nineteenth century with the development of the theory of electromagnetism. In the early stages, André-Marie Ampère and Charles-Augustin de Coulomb could manage with Newton-style laws that expressed the forces between pairs of electric charges or electric currents. However, it became much more natural to take the field approach and express these laws in terms of electric and magnetic fields; in 1849 Michael Faraday became the first to coin the term \"field\".\n\nThe independent nature of the field became more apparent with James Clerk Maxwell's discovery that waves in these fields propagated at a finite speed. Consequently, the forces on charges and currents no longer just depended on the positions and velocities of other charges and currents at the same time, but also on their positions and velocities in the past.\n\nMaxwell, at first, did not adopt the modern concept of a field as a fundamental quantity that could independently exist. Instead, he supposed that the electromagnetic field expressed the deformation of some underlying medium—the luminiferous aether—much like the tension in a rubber membrane. If that were the case, the observed velocity of the electromagnetic waves should depend upon the velocity of the observer with respect to the aether. Despite much effort, no experimental evidence of such an effect was ever found; the situation was resolved by the introduction of the special theory of relativity by Albert Einstein in 1905. This theory changed the way the viewpoints of moving observers were related to each other.  They became related to each other in such a way that velocity of electromagnetic waves in Maxwell's theory would be the same for all observers. By doing away with the need for a background medium, this development opened the way for physicists to start thinking about fields as truly independent entities.\n\nIn the late 1920s, the new rules of quantum mechanics were first applied to the electromagnetic field. In 1927, Paul Dirac used quantum fields to successfully explain how the decay of an atom to a lower quantum state led to the spontaneous emission of a photon, the quantum of the electromagnetic field. This was soon followed by the realization (following the work of Pascual Jordan, Eugene Wigner, Werner Heisenberg, and Wolfgang Pauli) that all particles, including electrons and protons, could be understood as the quanta of some quantum field, elevating fields to the status of the most fundamental objects in nature. That said, John Wheeler and Richard Feynman seriously considered Newton's pre-field concept of action at a distance (although they set it aside because of the ongoing utility of the field concept for research in general relativity and quantum electrodynamics).\n\nClassical fields\n\nThere are several examples of classical fields. Classical field theories remain useful wherever quantum properties do not arise, and can be active areas of research. Elasticity of materials, fluid dynamics and Maxwell's equations are cases in point.\n\nSome of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. Historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with Faraday's lines of force when describing the electric field. The gravitational field was then similarly described.\n\nNewtonian gravitation\n\nA classical field theory describing gravity is Newtonian gravitation, which describes the gravitational force as a mutual interaction between two masses.\n\nAny body with mass M is associated with a gravitational field g which describes its influence on other bodies with mass. The gravitational field of M at a point r in space corresponds to the ratio between force F that M exerts on a small or negligible test mass m located at r and the test mass itself:\n \nStipulating that m is much smaller than M ensures that the presence of m has a negligible influence on the behavior of M.\n\nAccording to Newton's law of universal gravitation, F(r) is given by\n\nwhere  is a unit vector lying along the line joining M and m and pointing from M to m. Therefore, the gravitational field of M is\n\nThe experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to an unprecedented level of accuracy leads to the identity that gravitational field strength is identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the equivalence principle, which leads to general relativity.\n\nBecause the gravitational force F is conservative, the gravitational field g can be rewritten in terms of the gradient of a scalar function, the gravitational potential Φ(r):\n\nElectromagnetism\n\nMichael Faraday first realized the importance of a field as a physical quantity, during his investigations into magnetism. He realized that electric and magnetic fields are not only fields of force which dictate the motion of particles, but also have an independent physical reality because they carry energy.\n\nThese ideas eventually led to the creation, by James Clerk Maxwell, of the first unified field theory in physics with the introduction of equations for the electromagnetic field.

For the last two years 'Varsity football has played havoc with my studies.  Already I have been forced to drop work in my freshman and sophomore years.  If I play football again it means that I shall fail to get my degree in four years, and I cannot afford a fifth.  It's either play football and fail to get a degree or abandon the gridiron and get a degree.\"  In addition to the toll the game had taken on his studies, Bill denounced football on moral grounds, stating that the human body was not meant to withstand the strain that football demands and adding, \"I don't believe the game is right.  I dislike it on moral grounds.  It is a mere gladiatorial combat.  It is brutal throughout.\"\n\nBrill's family lost its wealth in a financial collapse, and Brill thereafter worked his way through school as a waiter, janitor, and steel mill worker.

{"topic": "Homestar Runner", "document": "Homestar Runner is an American Flash animated comedy web series and website created by Mike and Matt Chapman, known collectively as The Brothers Chaps. The series centers on the adventures of a large and diverse cast of characters, headed by the titular character, Homestar Runner. It uses a blend of surreal humor, self-parody, satire, and references to popular culture, in particular video games, classic television, and popular music.\n\nHomestar Runner originated in 1996 as a book written by Mike Chapman and Craig Zobel, intended as a parody of children's literature. Whilst learning Macromedia Flash, Mike and his brother Matt expanded the concept into a website, which was launched on New Year's Day 2000. While the site originally centered on the title character, the Strong Bad Email cartoon skits quickly became the site's most popular and prominent feature, with Strong Bad, initially the series' main antagonist, becoming a breakout character. Since 2000, the site has grown to encompass a variety of cartoons and web games featuring Homestar, Strong Bad, and numerous other characters.\n\nAt the peak of its popularity, the site was one of the most-visited sites with collections of Flash cartoons on the web, spreading via word of mouth. The site sustains itself through merchandise sales and has never featured advertisements. The Brothers Chaps have turned down offers to make a television series.\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus beginning in 2010, Homestar Runner returned with a new Holiday Toon on April 1, 2014, for April Fools' Day. Afterwards, co-creator Matt Chapman announced plans to give the site semi-regular updates starting in fall 2014, due to the positive reception given to the April Fools' Day cartoon. Since global support for Flash ended on December 31, 2020, homestarrunner.com has maintained a fully functional website through the Flash emulator Ruffle.  More cartoons have since been released on the website and its YouTube channel on an occasional basis, usually to celebrate holidays.\n\nHistory\n\n1996–2000: Development\nHomestar Runner was created in Atlanta in 1996 by University of Georgia students Mike Chapman and friend Craig Zobel, who wrote the original picture book, The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest, while working summer jobs surrounding the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nMatt described the origin of the name \"Homestar Runner\" as a in-joke between themselves and James Huggins, a childhood friend of the Chapman brothers while growing up in Dunwoody, Georgia.\n\nWhen Mike and Craig were in a bookstore and made a remark about how \"awful\" the children's books were, the idea to write their own children's book occurred to them. They spent around two hours designing the look of Homestar Runner, Pom Pom, Strong Bad, and The Cheat, and completed the book within a day. They only printed about five to ten copies to share with friends, and had no intention to publish it. However, they had no idea that their father had sent out the book as a manuscript for submission to about 80 different publishers, but they only got rejection letters back, if anything. The pair began to work on a sequel, Homestar Runner Goes for the Gold, which would have introduced Strong Bad's brothers, Strong Mad and Strong Sad, but was eventually abandoned. They later used the Super NES video game Mario Paint to create the first cartoon featuring the characters.\n\n2000–2009: Launch and initial popularity\nAround 1999, Mike recognized how popular Flash animation was taking off, and he and his younger brother Matt Chapman started to learn Flash on their own. Looking for something on which to practice, they found inspiration in the old \"children's\" book. Their initial cartoons were launched on their dedicated website, homestarrunner.com, by 2000. Mike animated the cartoons, Matt provided the voices of the male characters, and Mike's girlfriend (now wife) Missy Palmer provided the voice of Marzipan.\n\nThey initially started off with shorts that featured competitions between Homestar Runner as a heroic character and Strong Bad as the villain, but these did not really capture viewers. Mike and Matt came up with the idea of animating the scenes between competitions; Matt stated \"that was the stuff that was funnier, the stuff happening between the plot points, which is hilarious because we hadn't even established a routine of making cartoons about competitions, we'd made like one\". From May 2000 to February 2001, the website and cartoons started out with different art styles. In February 2001, it gained a new look, which has largely remained consistent to the present with minor changes.\n\nThe site grew slowly at first and primarily through word-of-mouth. They were able to sell a \"few dozen\" T-shirts by 2001. Mike moved back to New York in mid-2001 and he and Matt started crafting the first Strong Bad Email some kinda robot, intending this to be a weekly feature. The Strong Bad Email series proved very popular, generating significant interest in the site; when the brothers were late in publishing a new Strong Bad Email, they received angry emails asking where the new short was, which Matt said was \"a cool feeling to know you're as important as a cup of coffee or morning crossword to some folks\". Their father suggested Matt quit his full-time job to devote time to creating more Homestar Runner shorts. With the number of visitors to the site growing, by January 2003 the site had outgrown its original web host, Yahoo!. Merchandise sales paid for all of the costs of running the website as well as living costs of the creators, whose retired parents managed many of the business aspects.\n\nThe brothers considered the period between 2002–2005 to be their most creative and successful, exploring various different media for the shorts and having a large quantity of merchandise. Matt considered a day in February 2004 to be the highlight of the series, having received a demo tape from They Might Be Giants for a song to use in a Strong Bad Email short and a life-sized replica of Tom Servo from Mystery Science Theater 3000 producer Jim Mallon on the same day. They also reflected on how Homestar Runner had been a common point of reference over which newly formed couples bonded and how Joss Whedon incorporated references to Homestar Runner into his television shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel as further signs of success.\n\n2009−2014: Hiatus\nThrough 2010, Homestar Runner remained financially viable for the brothers through sales of related merchandise. Both brothers were married by 2010 and had their children to care for, and they recognized that they would need to find other jobs to support their respective families. When Matt had a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing they would want to come back to it but could not guarantee a time frame. Mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break. The success of Homestar Runner led to Matt and Mike getting writing jobs for television animated series Yo Gabba Gabba!, Gravity Falls, The Aquabats! Super Show!, and Wander Over Yonder.\n\nDuring this hiatus, the brothers released a small number of Homestar Runner cartoons, including ones for 2010's April Fools' Day and Decemberween holidays. They also made a special video featuring Homestar and Strong Bad for the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con to introduce a panel regarding the history of W00tstock.\n\n2014–present: Comeback\nMatt, after completing work on Gravity Falls, moved back to Atlanta in 2014 where Mike was living, and the two agreed that they now had the opportunity to return to Homestar Runner on a semi-regular basis. Their first short in nearly four years, posted on April 1, 2014, poked fun at how they had not updated the site in years. Matt confirmed their commitment to continue the series in July 2014. Since then, the site has featured occasional updates, usually for holidays. Until 2017, this was mostly due to the brothers' involvement in developing the Disney XD animated show Two More Eggs.\n\nWith the discontinuation of Adobe Flash by the end of 2020, most new Homestar Runner content was released directly as videos to YouTube; they also worked to re-record the older Flash content into video format for archival purposes", "instruction": " What inspired the creation of Strong Bad's brothers, Strong Mad and Strong Sad?"}

{"topic": "Watab River", "document": "The Watab River, also known as Watab Creek, is a  tributary of the Mississippi River in Stearns County in central Minnesota in the United States.  It rises north of St. Joseph at the confluence of its North and South Forks, and flows northeast through Watab Lake, then east into the Mississippi River at Sartell.\n\nThe North Fork Watab River,  long, rises in Island Lake, a small creek feeds Pflueger Lake, flows northeasterly to Stumpf Lake, then southeasterly near Collegeville, merging with the South Fork near St. Joseph.\n\nThe South Fork Watab River,  long, flows southeast from Big Watab Lake to Little Watab Lake, and through a pond before flowing northeast and into North Fork Watab River.\n\nHistory\nThe word watab comes from the Ojibwe language wadab-ziibi (Lit. \"Spruce-Root River\") due to the many spruce trees whose exposed roots were once commonly found along its banks. The name Watab comes from the word watap, as the cordage used for sewing together  the birch-bark panels on the Ojibwe canoes was often made from spruce tree roots.\n\nIn 1825 the Watab River formed the first part of the border on the west side of the Mississippi between the Ojibwe people migrating from the north and the Dakota people to the south, and 20 years later the southern boundary for the Winnebago Reservation based in Long Prairie, Minnesota and lasting for less than ten years' duration. What is now the ghost town of Watab was located across the Mississippi River from the mouth of the Watab River.\n\nWriting in 1915, journalist and local historian William Bell Mitchell recalled that as of 1850, \"The Winnebagoes then had one of their main villages on the West bank of the Mississippi River, opposite Watab, and instead of remaining at home, were roaming around looking for a chance to play poker or some other gambling game, at which many of them were experts, or to obtain whiskey, for which they would give their last blanket. Sauk Rapids was then about two miles above the present village, where the fur company had their headquarters under the charge of Jeremiah Russell. Near the southwest corner of Stager's addition to Sauk Rapids was Calvin Potter's place, the primary attraction of which was a bar, and here were encounters between the Indians and White men, which resulted in the loss of life on both sides. One of these affairs in 1850 resulted in the sending of a party of government soldiers on the Governor Ramsey [steamboat] to Sauk Rapids, where a number of the Indians were arrested and taken to Watab, but afterwards released.\"\n\nThe Ho-Chunk stayed less than five years, moving again in 1853 50 miles south. Three years later they sold their grist and saw mills at the Watab River's mouth and moved south of Mankato. A 100-yard section of the old \"Indian Trail\" still remains just north of the creek's mouth albeit overgrown. The site of the village was still called \"Winnebago\" at the time of the 1866 ribbon map of the Mississippi River.\n\nDuring the early years of pioneer settlement by Stearns County Germans, the valley made by the North Fork of the Watab River was named (), meaning \"Beautiful Valley.\" According to local historian Coleman J. Barry, the beauty of the Watab Valley has also inspired many works of locally composed German poetry.\n\nSee also\n List of rivers of Minnesota\n\nReferences\n\nRivers of Minnesota\nTributaries of the Mississippi River\nRivers of Stearns County, Minnesota\nGerman language in the United States\nHo-Chunk", "instruction": " What significant industries were located along the shores of Big and Little Watab Lakes during the late 1800s?"}

{"topic": "Plessey AR-3D", "document": "The AR-3D was a military air traffic control and early warning radar developed by Plessey and first produced in 1975. It used a pencil beam and simple frequency scanning system known as \"squint scan\" to produce a low-cost 3D radar system that was also relatively mobile. About 23 were produced in total and found sales around the world into the early 1980s.\n\nThe frequency scanning system had the disadvantage that a target aircraft would always be \"painted\" by the same frequency signal, which made the task of jamming the radar simpler. This limited its sales prospects to military users, and shortly after delivering the AR-3D the company began negotiations with the US company ITT-Gillifan to incorporate their multi-frequency scanning with the AR-3D's receivers and display systems to produce the Plessey AR-320.\n\nHistory\n\nSquint\nDuring the installation of the first high-power microwave frequency radars using slot antennas, operators of the AMES Type 14 noticed that the apparent angle of the \"blips\" on the radar display did not always match the physical angle of the antenna. This was traced to an effect in the waveguides, which had slightly different transmission characteristics based on frequency. When the cavity magnetron warmed and cooled during use, its frequency changed slightly, and a delay was introduced in the waveguide. This caused the signal to no longer exactly match the positioning of the radiators in the antenna, and caused the beam to shift. This effect became known as \"squint\" and was generally considered annoying, especially on the AMES Type 80 where servicing the magnetron required a lengthy recalibration process to bring the beam back in line with the antenna.\n\nThrough the 1960s, significant effort was put into developing \"squintless feeds\" that avoided this problem, but the problem also presented an opportunity. Squint is caused by the waveguide system slowing the signal by different amounts depending on the frequency. If the signal exits through a slotted waveguide antenna, this slight shift in timing produces a phase shift of the output. This shift will cause the resulting wavefront to change direction. This is the basis of the phased array radar, which normally accomplishes this using signal delay electronics. As squint causes a similar delay, it can also be used to steer the beam. This leads to the possibility of radar that can scan its beam in a chosen direction, typically vertically, with no moving parts.\n\nSQUIRT\nAnother technique that was being widely explored in the late 1950s and early 1960s was the technique of pulse compression. Pulse compression greatly increases the range resolution of a radar, which was formerly defined almost entirely by its pulse width. To get the required resolution in older designs, pulses were very short, typically a few microseconds, which required massive power output in order to produce a detectable reflected signal. Using pulse compression, the pulses could be much longer, at least ten times, meaning the same return signal would be produced with  the peak output.\n\nPulse compression works by changing the frequency of the signal over the time of the pulse and then delaying the returned signal based on its frequency. This compresses the return into a short pulse that can then be used for accurate ranging. This presented a potential issue in a radar using squint scanning, which would presumably send the signals in different directions if pulse compression were used. It appeared that as long as the beam steering was at the right speed it would be possible to do both; a given target would only see a small change in frequency as the beam scanned passed it, but the signal would dwell on any one target long enough that there would be a notable frequency shift during the resulting reflection that could be used for pulse compression.\n\nIn 1964, Plessey won a contract to consider the issue and began development of an experimental system. This was completed in 1967 as SQUIRT. Early tests demonstrated the system worked in theory, but the returned signal was weak and the system did not have the desired detection range. The system was modified and testing resumed in 1968 with the result that the detection range had improved but the height finding accuracy was lower than desired. It was finally concluded that the difference in the performance of the system across the 10 MHz bandwidth was too great to be practical.\n\nAR-3D\nPlessey felt the basic concept still offered significant benefits, at least in less-demanding roles, and that it could be greatly improved by increasing the bandwidth past what was possible with its original 1960s-era systems. In 1973 they received Ministry of Defence (MoD) funding to build an example set with a potential 150 MHz bandwidth, which was operational the next year. In 1975, the company put it on the market as the AR-3D, offered for military air traffic control (ATC) and \"limited air defense purposes\". The ideal market would be day-to-day traffic control around a military airport, where the secondary function of early warning would still be useful. It was displayed publicly at the Paris Air Show in 1975. At the time, they predicted sales of up to 50 systems worldwide.\n\nThe system as a whole consisted of the antenna and its mount, six short semi-trailers of equipment, and one full-length semi-trailer with the operations room. It was airmobile via Chinook helicopter. Sales followed with Egypt taking three units, South Africa ten, and Qatar and Ecuador two each. The RAF used one in Germany for ATC around RAF Gatow and sent two to the Falkland Islands in January 1983 followed by another in February 1984. According to Burr, the countries were assigned code names, with Penguin referring to the UK Ministry of Defence, and Rodent, Condor, Lion and Falcon to outside-UK sales. This list shows a total of 23 examples being produced. Those used by the RAF were given the name AMES Type 94.\n\nNewspaper reports from 1986 state another six were sold to Iran, but it is not clear if this is included in the list above or represents new-build systems. Given the late date of the sale, this may be systems \"recycled\" from RAF use or other sales.\n\nAR-320\n\nAlthough successful in the market, the AR-3D had the significant disadvantage in the military role in that a particular target would always be \"painted\" by the same frequency signal, and thus jamming the signal would be greatly simplified. Most other 3D radars of the era did not use squint scanning and thus did not suffer from this problem. Seeking a way to apply their work on the AR-3D to a new frequency agile radar, Plessey entered an agreement with ITT-Gilfillan of Los Angeles. Gilfillan also used squint scanning, but did so at different frequencies with each pulse, and thus avoided the problems with the AR-3D. Gilfillan supplied a new antenna and transmitters, while Plessey supplied suitably modified versions of the existing receiver and display systems. The result was the Plessey AR-320, which replaced the AR-3D in the market.\n\nDescription\nThe system was packaged as a complete unit known as the Type 40/80-5 Command and Control Post. This consisted of the antenna unit on a four-legged mounting, a Transmitter Cabin, two Diesel Generators, Communications Cabin, Workshop Cabin and the Processing and Control Cabin. Most of these were in the form of short semi-trailers, although the Processing and Control Cabin was full-length. Although designed primarily to be pulled by prime movers, the system was also airmobile via Chinook helicopter.\n\nThe antenna rotated around its vertical axis to scan in azimuth. The reflector took the form of a vertical cylindrical paraboloid, with the lower corners cropped off. The end-fed slot feed antenna was held in front of the reflector by three sets of legs forming triangular supports, one at the top and two at the bottom, the lowest also feeding the signal. The antenna was mounted at one end of its support platform, seemingly unbalanced, while the Transmitter Cabin was positioned at the other where it connected to a waveguide running along the top of the platform.\n\nThe transmitter used two stages, the first being a travelling wave tube and the second a grid klystron. Total peak power was 1.1 MW while average power was 10 kW. The transmitter had a bandwidth of 140 MHz during its 36 microseconds pulses.\n\nOn reception, the signal was converted to an intermediate frequency and then split into eight signal paths, each of which accepted a range", "instruction": " What was the specific height finding accuracy achieved with the SQUIRT system during its final testing stage?"}
{"topic": "Killer in the backseat", "document": "The killer in the backseat (also known as High Beams) is an urban legend from the United States and United Kingdom. It was first noted by folklorist Carlos Drake in 1968 in texts collected by Indiana University students.\n\nLegend\nThe legend involves a woman who is driving and being followed by a car or truck. The mysterious pursuer flashes his high beams, tailgates her, and sometimes even rams her vehicle. When she finally makes it home, she realizes that the driver was trying to warn her that there was a man (a murderer, or escaped mental patient) hiding in her back seat. Each time the man sat up to attack her, the driver behind had used his high beams to scare the killer, causing him to duck back down.\n\nIn some versions, the woman stops for gas, and the attendant asks her to come inside to sort out a problem with her credit card. Inside the station, he asks if she knows there's a man in her back seat. (An example of this rendition can be seen in the 1998 episode of Millennium, \"The Pest House\".) In another, she sees a doll on the road in the moors, stops, and then the man gets in the back.\n\nIn another version, the woman gets into her car and then a crazed person leaps out from nowhere and starts shouting gibberish and slamming their hands on the car. The woman quickly manages to escape from them but no matter how far or which direction she drives, every time she stops, the same crazy person appears and attacks the car. The woman then arrives at a police station and tells the police about the crazed person. The police calm her down and offer to drive her back to her house (or a safe place in other versions). But when they go with her to get her things from the car, they find the killer hiding behind the driver's seat. As it turns out, the crazed person that was chasing the woman was the ghost of one of the killer's victims, trying to either warn the woman or get at the killer.\n\nOrigin\nThe story has been identified as circulating at least as early as the late 1960s, and may have gained more widespread recognition after appearing in a letter to advice columnist Ann Landers in 1982. It has been speculated, including by Snopes founder David Mikkelson, that the legend may have been inspired by a vaguely similar case which took place in 1964, in which an escaped murderer hid in the backseat of a car, only to end up shot by the car's owner, a police detective. Other somewhat similar, though not identical, cases have since been noted, including by folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand.\n\nInterpretations\n\nThe story is often told with a moral. The attendant is often a lumberjack, a trucker, or a scary-looking man: someone the driver mistrusts without reason. She assumes it is the attendant who wants to do her harm, when in reality it is he who saves her life.\n\nIn popular culture \n The Twilight Zone episode \"Perchance to Dream\" is notable for its protagonist's allusions to 'that woman who was killed by a psychopath hiding in the back seat of her car', in an episode first broadcast around eight or nine years before the story is believed to have entered into urban legend. It is unknown if this is pure coincidence or deliberately referencing some otherwise unrecorded 'proto-myth', or even perhaps helped to inspire the legend.\n John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween has the character Annie Brackett killed when she enters the car and the killer Michael Myers sneaks up from behind the back seat and slashes her throat.\n A version of the story by author Alvin Schwartz appears in the 1981 collection of short horror stories for children Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.\n Terror in Topanga, the first segment of the 1983 anthology film Nightmares, is a depiction of this legend. \n The story is featured in a 1992 an episode of The Simpsons when Otto tells Lisa the legend as a bedtime story. In his version, the victim is chased by another car that keeps ramming her vehicle, and she drives off the road into the woods and loses the other car. She is then killed by an axe-wielding maniac who had been hiding in her backseat. He then reveals himself to be said maniac.\n The 1998 film Urban Legend begins with this scenario.\n In a 1998 episode of Millennium, \"The Pest House\", Frank Black chases a doctor from a mental hospital after one of its patients escapes into the back of her car and tries to kill her. When she pulls over at a gas station, the attendant saves her by taking her inside.\n The story is featured in a 1998 episode of the television show Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction under the title \"Bright Lights\".\n A 2003 episode of the detective series Jonathan Creek, \"The Coonskin Cap\", begins with a version of this legend, except that instead of a killer inside the car, the pursuing driver is trying to alert the woman that there is a body tied to the back of her car.\n The 2003 Tamil film from India, Whistle, begins with this scenario.\nIn the 2009 film Zombieland, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) explains to Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) that Rule #10 of surviving a zombie apocalypse is to check the backseat for hidden dangers, such as re-animated zombies. Later on in the film, after getting robbed at gunpoint again, Tallahassee admits to Columbus that Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) got the drop on him and Tallahassee because he (Tallahassee) didn't check the backseat.\nIn the 2013 film Curse of Chucky, Nica Pierce is sent to a psychiatric hospital, suspected of a set of killings committed by Chucky. As the arresting officer gets into his car, Tiffany Valentine, who had been hiding in the back seat, slits his throat with a nail file.\n In the 2015 episode of Scream Queens, \"Ghost Stories\", Chanel #5 (played by Abigail Breslin) is driving and a truck starts honking at her and using his high beams. When she pulls over at a petrol station, he tells her about the Red-Devil (the murderer), lurking in her back seat but then he is stabbed by it while #5 makes her escape.\n The 2022 episode of American Horror Stories, \"Drive\", Marci (played by Bella Thorne) is driving home from a night club and a jeep starts flashing its high beams at her. Marci loses the jeep and hides behind a car wash. Her friend Piper tells Marci of the legend. Later, it's revealed the driver of the jeep really did see someone in the backseat, but it wasn't a killer, it was actually someone Marci kidnapped herself, subverting the legend.\n\nSee also\nBalete Drive White Lady\n\nReferences\n\nEntry at Snopes\nInfo at About.com \n Brunvand, Jan Harold.

{"topic": "William Paterson (explorer)", "document": "Colonel William Paterson, FRS (17 August 1755 – 21 June 1810) was a Scottish soldier, explorer, Lieutenant Governor and botanist best known for leading early settlement at Port Dalrymple in Tasmania. In 1795, Paterson gave an order that resulted in the massacre of a number of men, women and children, members of the Bediagal tribe.\n\nEarly years\nA native of Montrose, Scotland, Paterson was interested in botany as a boy and trained in horticulture at Syon in London. Paterson was sent to the Cape Colony by the wealthy and eccentric Countess of Strathmore to collect plants, he arrived in Table Bay on board the \"Houghton\" in May 1777. He made four trips into the interior between May 1777 and March 1780, when he departed. In 1789 Paterson published Narrative of Four Journeys into the Country of the Hottentots and Caffraria, which he dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks.\n\nCareer\nPaterson was originally commissioned as an ensign in the 98th Regiment of Foot and served in India. He later transferred to the 73rd Regiment of Foot after the 98th's disbandment in 1787. In 1789, he was promoted to captain in the New South Wales Corps, serving under Major Francis Grose. After some time spent recruiting, he arrived in Sydney in October 1791. From November 1791 until March 1793 he served in command on Norfolk Island. Whilst there he collected botanical, geological and insect specimens and sent them to Banks. He also provided seed to the Lee and Kennedy and Colvill nurseries.  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1798.\n\nIn 1794 he served for a year as Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales. In 1800 he was re-appointed to the post and served a second term until 1808.\n\nIn May 1795, following the alleged killing of two settlers Paterson ordered two officers and 66 soldiers to:\n\n destroy as many (Aboriginal Australians) as they could meet with ... in the hope of striking terror, to erect gibbets in different places, whereon the bodies of all they might kill were to be hung ...\n\nSeven or eight Bediagal people were killed. A crippled man, some children and five women (one being heavily pregnant) were taken to Sydney as prisoners. One of the women and her baby had serious gunshot wounds. The child died not long after as did the newborn baby of the pregnant woman.\n\nIn 1801, Paterson fought a duel with John Macarthur and was wounded in the shoulder.\n \nHe led an expedition to the Hunter Region in 1801 and up the Paterson River (later named in his honour by Governor King). The expedition discovered coal in the area that would later become the vast South Maitland Coalfields; it was a discovery of great economic significance. In 1804, he led an expedition to Port Dalrymple, in what is now Tasmania, exploring the Tamar River and going up the North Esk River farther than European had previously gone.\n\nBetween 1804 and 1808 Paterson was also appointed Commandant at Port Dalrymple, the administrator of the colony in the north of Van Diemen's Land. In 1806, Paterson's duties as commander of the New South Wales Corps required him to return to Sydney, but he went back to Van Diemen's Land in 1807, and stayed until December 1808. During this time he corresponded regularly with the eminent naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, sending a number of specimens.\n\nThe New South Wales Corps selected Paterson as acting Governor of New South Wales on 1 January 1809 after the deposition of Governor Captain William Bligh in the so-called \"Rum Rebellion.\" He was replaced by the newly arrived Lachlan Macquarie by the end of the year. He left Sydney for England on 12 May 1810, but died on board HMS Dromedary while off Cape Horn just a few weeks later.\n\nHis widow Elizabeth married Francis Grose, Paterson's predecessor as Lieutenant Governor, in April 1814, but Grose died a month later. Elizabeth died in Liverpool, England in 1839.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n Alexander, Alison (editor) (2005), The Companion to Tasmanian History, Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies, University of Tasmania, Hobart. .\n Vernon S.

{"topic": "Fortean Times", "document": "Fortean Times is a British monthly magazine devoted to the anomalous phenomena popularised by Charles Fort. Previously published by John Brown Publishing (from 1991 to 2001), I Feel Good Publishing (2001 to 2005), Dennis Publishing (2005 to 2021), and Exponent (2021), as of December 2021 it is published by Diamond Publishing, part of Metropolis International.\n\nIn December 2018, its print circulation was just over 14,800 copies per month. This now appears to include digital sales. The magazine's tagline is \"The World of Strange Phenomena\".\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\nThe roots of the magazine that was to become Fortean Times can be traced back to Bob Rickard's discovering the works of Charles Fort through the secondhand method of reading science-fiction stories:\n\"John Campbell, the editor of Astounding Science Fiction  (as Analog was then titled), for example,\" writes Rickard \"encouraged many authors to expand Fort's data and comments into imaginative stories.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s, while Rickard was studying product design at Birmingham Art College, he met several like-minded science-fiction fans, particularly crediting fellow student Peter Weston's fan-produced Speculation magazine as helping him to \"[learn] the art of putting together a fanzine,\" some years before he created his own. Attending a science-fiction convention in 1968, Rickard obtained Ace paperback copies of all four of Fort's books from a stall run by Derek Stokes (later to run Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed, and take a role in the day-to-day running of The Fortean Times).\n\nAfter reading an advertisement in the underground magazine Oz (in 1969) for the International Fortean Organization (INFO), an American group \"founded in 1966... by Paul and Ronald Willis,\" who had acquired material from the original Fortean Society (started in 1931, but in limbo since the 1959 death of its founder Tiffany Thayer), Rickard began to correspond with the brothers, particularly Paul. Rickard was instrumental in encouraging the Willises to publish their own Fortean journal – the INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown began intermittent publication in spring, 1967 – and sent them many British newspaper clippings, although few came to print.\n\nRickard later discovered that the production was fraught behind-the-scenes, as Ronald Willis had been seriously ill, Paul thus finding it difficult to \"keep up with things\" on his own. Ultimately, the Willises were instrumental in inspiring Rickard to create his own periodical. Ron Willis succumbed to a brain tumour in March 1975. Bearing a date of  November 1973, the first issue of Rickard's self-produced and self-published The News was available directly from him.\n\nThe News (1973–1976)\nThe magazine which was to continue Fort's work documenting the unexplained was founded by Robert JM \"Bob\" Rickard in 1973 as his self-published, bimonthly, mail-order \"hobbyish newsletter\" miscellany The News — \"A Miscellany of Fortean Curiosities\". The title is said to be \"a contraction taken from Samuel Butler's The News from Nowhere\", (although Rickard may be conflating/confusing Butler's Erewhon and William Morris' News from Nowhere). The News had fairly regular bimonthly publication for 15 issues between November 1973 and April 1976. Debuting at 35p (£1.80/$4.50 for a year of six issues) for 20 pages, The News was produced on Rickard's typewriter, with headings created with Letraset, during (as Rickard says in #2) the late-1970s blackouts. The first issue featured a cover (which would become briefly the unofficial logo of The News) drawn by Rickard from a Selfridges advertisement originally created by Bernard Partridge. From the second issue, pictures and photographs from various newspapers were interpolated within the text. The price was raised slightly for #6 — which also had its page count upped to 24 pages — due in large part to rising postal and paper costs.\n\nHelping behind the scenes was Steve Moore, a kindred spirit whom Rickard met at a comics convention when the latter was a subeditor at IPC. The two found they had much in common, including a love of Chinese mysticism, and Moore helped inspire Rickard to publish The News. The early issues featured some articles by different individuals, but were \"largely the work of Bob Rickard, who typed them himself with some help from Steve Moore.\"\n\nKey News-people\nMoore and Paul Screeton (then editor of The Ley Hunter), both urged on the first few uncertain issues\" and Moore frequently joined Rickard to \"stuff envelopes and hand-write a few hundred addresses\" to disseminate the early issues. Rickard also highlights amongst the key early Fortean Times advocates and supporters: Ion Alexis Will, who discovered The News in 1974 and became a \"constant [source] of valuable clippings, books, postcards, and entertaining letters\"; Janet and Colin Bord, later authors of Mysterious Britain (Janet also wrote for Flying Saucer Review and Lionel Beer's Spacelink, while Colin's Fortean article in Gandalf's Garden was particularly cited by Rickard as bringing him/them to his attention); Phil Ledger, a \"peripatetic marine biologist\", and The News' \"first enthusiastic fan\"; Ken Campbell, Fortean theatre director and playwright; John Michell; graphic designer Richard Adams and Dick Gwynn, who both helped with the evolving layout and typesetting of later issues; Chris Squire, who helped organise the first subscription database; Canadian \"Mr. X\"; Mike Dash; and cartoonist Hunt Emerson. Emerson was introduced to Rickard in late 1974, when after seven issues, he \"wanted to improve the graphics\", which Emerson certainly did, providing around 30 headings for use in issues #8 onwards. (Emerson's still-on-going monthly \"Phenomenomix\" strip in FT had its prototype in #11's three-page \"Fortean Funnies\").\n\nNotable News content\nOther early contributors included writer and researcher Nigel Watson (chairman of the Scunthorpe UFO Research Society), who wrote \"Mysterious Moon\" for The News #2. Watson later wrote a regular column of UFO commentary entitled Enigma Variations (from #29), and articles on the subject of UFO-related murders and stories of sexual assault by aliens. Phil Grant wrote about Ley lines for #3, and Mary Caine, who revised an earlier article (from Gandalf's Garden) on The Glastonbury Zodiac for issue #4, which also had the debut of the \"Reviews\" section, beginning with comments on a book by John Michell, the Sphere reprint of Charles Fort's New Lands and John Sladek's The New Apocrypha.\nIssues #2 and #3 noted, The News was published \"with an arrangement with INFO\", this was revised from #4 to it being \"affiliated to the International Fortean Organization\". From #5, Mark A. Hall produced a section entitled \"Fortean USA\", continuing on from his earlier, discontinued, newsletter From My Files; issue #5 also had William Porter's article on Llandrillo printed, after being delayed from #4 for space constraints. Janet Bord contributed \"Some Fortean Ramblings\" alongside William R. Corliss's \"The Evolution of the Fortean Sourcebooks\" for #7, and issue #8 was the first issue of volume 2, after Rickard decided to end volume 1 with #7 (not #6 as fully bimonthly titles do), since that issue was dated November '74, thereby attempting to keep each volume aligned with a year.\n\nIssue #8 (or, volume 2, issue #1) got the special \"Christmas present\" of headings by Hunt Emerson, after Rickard was introduced to Emerson by Carol and Nick Moore, as Hunt was working on Large Cow Comix. Described by Rickard as \"as much a disciple of George [Herriman]... and my [Rickard's] favourite artists from Mad (Bill Elder and Wally Wood)\" as Rickard was of Charles Fort, the", "instruction": " What significant events or milestones marked the transition of The News into Fortean Times, leading up to its current form as a widely recognized and established magazine?"}

{"topic": "Organisation-based access control", "document": "In computer security, organization-based access control (OrBAC) is an access control model first presented in 2003.  The current approaches of the access control rest on the three entities (subject, action, object) to control the access the policy specifies that some subject has the permission to realize some action on some object.\n\nOrBAC allows the policy designer to define a security policy independently of the implementation. The chosen method to fulfill this goal is the introduction of an abstract level.\n\n Subjects are abstracted into roles.  A role is a set of subjects to which the same security rule apply.\n Similarly, an activity is a set of actions to which the same security rule apply.\n And, a view is a set of objects to which the same security rule apply.\n\nEach security policy is defined for and by an organization. Thus, the specification of the security policy is completely parameterized by the organization so that it is possible to handle simultaneously several security policies associated with different organizations. The model is not restricted to permissions, but also includes the possibility to specify prohibitions and obligations. From the three abstract entities (roles, activities, views), abstract privileges are defined. And from these abstract privileges, concrete privileges are derived.\n\nOrBAC is context sensitive, so the policy could be expressed dynamically. Furthermore, OrBAC owns concepts of hierarchy (organization, role, activity, view, context) and separation constraints.\n\nSee also\n\nExternal links\n OrBAC site\n MotOrBAC site (OrBAC simulation and conflict detection tool)\n\nComputer access control\nAccess control", "instruction": " What specific benefits does the use of hierarchies and separation constraints provide in Organization-based Access Control (OrBAC) compared to traditional access control models?"}

{"topic": "Ocean Rowing Society International", "document": "Ocean Rowing Society International (ORSI) (prior to 2006 known as ORS), is the governing body for international ocean rowing and official adjudicator of ocean rowing records for Guinness World Records. ORSI was founded in 1983 in California by ocean rower Peter Bird and Kenneth F.Crutchlow FRGS. Current coordinators of ORSI are Tatiana Rezvaya-Crutchlow and Chris Martin, and Fiann Paul.\n\nHistory \nThe Ocean Rowing Society (from 2006 – International) was founded in 1983 by Kenneth Frank Crutchlow, with support of an ocean rower Peter Bird. The reason, that urged them to do it, was a letter from a French journalist, asking if there existed a list of British ocean rowers.  He was writing about the row of French Gerard d'Aboville and wondered how to compare it to the achievements of the other ocean rowers. The main goal of the Society was and still is to keep record of all attempts to row across the oceans.\n\nIn 1983, after almost 90 years since the first ocean row in history, there had been only 32 attempts to row an ocean, and only 14 of them had been successful. The Ocean Rowing Society completed full and accurate information about all and each of them, to verify and to classify every row in the pre-Internet era. And since then, ORS has been the only body that keeps records of all events in the field of ocean rowing activity. The Ocean Rowing Society Int. is an official adjudicator of ocean rowing records for the Guinness World Records.\n\nD. H. Clarke from Guinness World Records in 1964 pioneered recording of ocean rows. He handed over to Kenneth Crutchlow all his notes that laid the basis for the statistics. And ocean rowers Geoff Allum and Mike Nestor, who provided ORS with their records and numerous cuttings from press articles, and helped with the compiling of the first list of the statistics. In 2000 Tom Lynch, an American Director of ORS, handed over the maintenance of the website to Ukrainian Theodore Rezvoy, who has designed website's current interface and created logo of ORS, placing there a saying in Latin. It expresses the inner motto of this extreme adventure: \"Nosce Te Ipsum\" – Know Thyself. \"Know yourself, test yourself, challenge yourself and succeed – the greatest victory for an individual, that's what all this is about.\"\n\nIn 2001 Tatiana Rezvaya-Crutchlow, became and still is the Editor-in-Chief of the ORS website. She is in charge of maintaining and updating the general statistics, as well as compiling its various options, selected by the aspect of the route, category, class, age, gender, country, duration, etc. In 1980 Kenneth for the first time used ARGOS satellite beacons to track the row of Peter Bird across the Pacific Ocean from Russian Far East to San Francisco; and hence, after launching the website, ORS became the first to start monitoring and tracking rowers at sea, listing positions, plotting charts and posting them – along with the press articles, news and other information about and from rowers at sea, – making it available to public.\n\nORS has coordinated dozens of rows of individuals and in 2004 organized the first race with Solos and Four entrees (besides traditional Teams of Two – that had been the only class of entrees in races 1997, 2001 and 2003). It was then, that ORS introduced a convenient  way of tracking numerous boats on one chart on the webpage, by marking them as dots of different colors – the way adopted later by organizers of other races. ORS has been one of the first contacts in the list of the Coast Guards, when it goes about rescue at sea of independent rowers. It assists by providing/confirming the necessary data, positions, contacts, etc. Kenneth F.Crutchlow was the first to organize a resupply of an ocean rower on route (Peter Bird, Pacific Ocean 1983) and then organized and participated in several resupplies of rowers and teams at sea – sailing and flying, or coordinating a meeting with a vessel or even another rowboat. ORSI organized the first meeting of entries in the 1997 race and in 2002 – meeting with all women-ocean rowers, at the Royal Geographical Society in London. It also organized lunches for ocean rowers with representatives of Guinness World Records on the occasions of awarding Guinness certificates to ocean rowers.\n\nIn 2000 ORS  formed a committee of ocean rowers who prepared \"guidelines\" for those who might themselves want to accept the Challenge of an Ocean Row. There was established a record \"Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing\", to be presented to the holders of the record \"The fastest row across the Atlantic East to West along the \"Trade Winds I\", – the most popular and rowed route of all in the world oceans. In 2017 Blue Riband Trophy was divided into two classes: classic and open. In 2003 ORS came up with an idea of organizing free seminars, where ocean rowers, coast guard helicopter pilots, psychologists, specialists in survival at sea shared their experience with those who were planning or about to go to sea. ORS sees as its task to keep alive and honor names of the past ocean rowers. A number of ocean rowboats related to the pioneers of ocean rowing have been saved from destruction, exhibited at several boat shows and finally presented to the relevant museums and organizations. In 2006 ORS became ORSI. \n\nIn 2021 Fiann Paul developed a geodatabase that documents and processes the entire history of human-power ocean-exploration, dubbed by Guinness World Records “The first real adventure database”.

{"topic": "Rotating calipers", "document": "In computational geometry, the method of rotating calipers is an algorithm design technique that can be used to solve optimization problems including finding the width or diameter of a set of points.\n\nThe method is so named because the idea is analogous to rotating a spring-loaded vernier caliper around the outside of a convex polygon. Every time one blade of the caliper lies flat against an edge of the polygon, it forms an antipodal pair with the point or edge touching the opposite blade. The complete \"rotation\" of the caliper around the polygon detects all antipodal pairs; the set of all pairs, viewed as a graph, forms a thrackle. The method of rotating calipers can be interpreted as the projective dual of a sweep line algorithm in which the sweep is across slopes of lines rather than across - or -coordinates of points.\n\nHistory \n\nThe rotating calipers method was first used in the dissertation of Michael Shamos in 1978. Shamos used this method to generate all antipodal pairs of points on a convex polygon and to compute the diameter of a convex polygon in  time. Godfried Toussaint coined the phrase \"rotating calipers\" and demonstrated that the method was applicable in solving many other computational geometry problems.\n\nShamos's algorithm \nShamos gave the following algorithm in his dissertation (pp. 77–82) for the rotating calipers method, which generated all antipodal pairs of vertices on a convex polygon:\n\n/* p[] is in standard form, ie, counter clockwise order, \n     distinct vertices, no collinear vertices.\n   ANGLE(m, n) is a procedure that returns the clockwise angle \n     swept out by a ray as it rotates from a position parallel \n     to the directed segment Pm,Pm+1 to a position parallel to Pn, Pn+1\n   We assume all indices are reduced to mod N (so that N+1 = 1).\n*/\nGetAllAntiPodalPairs(p[1..n])\n    // Find first anti-podal pair by locating vertex opposite P1\n    i = 1\n    j = 2\n    while angle(i, j) < pi\n        j++\n    yield i, j\n\n    /* Now proceed around the polygon taking account of\n         possibly parallel edges.

{"topic": "Somerville (surname)", "document": "Somerville is a Scottish surname of Norman origin.\n\nDerivation\nAlso for years the origin of the name was quoted from the book of surnames of Scotland, a copy did exist in the library of the University of Abertay in Dundee, stating the name originating from Caen or possibly from the commune of Sémerville (Semervilla 1209), near Évreux, that is 141 miles from Caen. However, there are other possibilities, first of all a disappeared place name of Cotentin Sumelleville (Summerleevilla ab 1210) closer to Caen. Other hypothesis like Sommervieu (Sommerveium 1241), 18,5 miles from Caen, were proposed.\n\nHistory\nIn 1066 the Lord of Somerville, Sir Gaultier / Walter de Somerville joined William the conqueror on his invasion of England, for his support Sir Gaultier de Somerville was given land in the North of England. By the twelfth century, the Somervilles were granted land and title of lord in Scotland and were at one time among the noble families of Scotland. Alternatively, Somerville can also be a Scottish clan surname.\n\nThe Irish House of Somerville began when William Somerville came to Ireland in 1690. William was an Episcopalian minister forced to flee from his manse when it was attacked by Covenanters. William brought his sons William and Thomas with him to Ireland. While the younger William returned to Scotland, his brother Thomas stayed in Ireland. Thomas would be educated at Trinity College in Dublin eventually earning a BA in 1711. He entered the church of his father and was ordained a minister at Cloyne Cathedral in 1715. It was in 1732 that Thomas was made the rector of Myross and Castlehaven. It was his son Thomas who by becoming a very successful merchant with Newfoundland and the West Indies was able to build up the Irish house of Somerville to the ranks of landed gentry a class out of which the Somerville clan had dropped for five generations.\n\nPeople\nThe following people have the surname Somerville (or the variant Somervile):\n\nAmanda Somerville (b. 1979), American pop, metal singer\nAnnis Somerville, New Zealand judge\nAlexander Somerville (1811–1885), Scottish journalist and soldier\nAlexander Neill Somerville, Scottish minister and evangelist\nAnnesley Somerville (1858–1942), British politician\nBonnie Somerville (b. 1974), American actress\nCarla Somerville (b. 1973), Canadian field hockey player\nDaniel Somerville (1879–1938), British politician\nDave Somerville (1933–2015), Canadian singer\nEd Somerville (1853–1877), American baseball player\nEdith Anna Somerville (1858–1949), Irish novelist\nGeraldine Somerville (b. 1967), Irish-born British actress\nGreg Somerville, NZ rugby player\nHenry Boyle Townshend Somerville (1863–1936), brother of Edith, sailor, antiquarian, anthropologist, killed by the IRA\nJames Somerville (Bruce County politician) (1826–1898), Canadian businessperson, notary and Member of Parliament (Bruce West electoral district)\nJames Somerville (Wentworth County, Ontario politician) (1834–1916), Canadian journalist, editor and Member of Parliament (Brant North, Wentworth North and Brant electoral districts)\nJames Somerville (admiral) (1882–1949), British admiral during World War II\nJames Dugald Somerville, best known as J.

{"topic": "Roubaix, South Dakota", "document": "Roubaix (), formerly known as Perry or Lewisville, is an unincorporated community in Lawrence County, South Dakota, United States. It is not monitored by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nNaming\nRoubaix was originally called Lewisville, but it was changed to Perry when the town gained a post office. When the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad began building into the Black Hills, the town again changed its name to avoid confusion with Terry, which was nearby. Roubaix was chosen in honor of the hometown of local Frenchman Pierre Wibaux, who was one of the Uncle Sam Mine's main investors.\n\nHistory\n\nFounding and growth\nThe mining camp was first settled in 1876. It was first a placer mining camp, with the primary source of gold being nearby Elk Creek. The town nearly disappeared after the Uncle Sam Mine was shut down in 1880, and a forest fire destroyed a large portion of the town. The grand reopening of Roubaix and its official recognition as a town was marked by a celebration in August 1885 at a beer hall, complete with a dance. In the years following 1891, due to failed mining activity, the town nearly became abandoned. In 1899, Roubaix had 500 residents, a post office, several stores, a hospital, boarding houses, a newspaper, a barber shop, a few churches, and its own city hall. There was once a typhoid fever epidemic in the area. The town was home to several organizations, including a tennis club, literature group, whist club, and a miners' union. Before the early 1900s, there was no designated school building, and classes were held in various buildings around camp.\n\nLocal mining operations\nRoubaix relied heavily on the Uncle Sam Mine, which was discovered in 1878 and produced gold. Quartz was later harvested in a one-stamp mill that made $50,000. By 1880, the new mine had closed and was flooded. In 1885, more stamps for the stamp mills were brought from Tigerville, and a 60-stamp mill was brought from Esmeralda. By October 1886, after a change in management, the mine began to have trouble with its water pumps. The resulting drop in activity nearly caused Roubaix to become abandoned. In 1898, the Clover Leaf Gold Mining Company arrived, headed by Pierre Wibaux. They bought the mine and repaired the 60-stamp mill, fixed the buildings, brought in a sawmill, and had electricity installed. From 1889 to 1905, Wibaux mined $900,000 worth of gold. Most of the ore was pure, and simple mercury amalgamation allowed for 90% of the ore to be recovered. This new activity revived the town. However, Wibaux's fellow miners began stealing the ore, causing him to lose profits.\n\nOn June 4, 1905, the fires were pulled to clean the boilers, and the 7th-level sill floor caved in. The water blocked the pumps and caused them to burn out. Pressure from the boiler caused the dam to break and flood the lower levels. A fissure in Elk Creek was supposed, and plans were made to build a diversion dam, but it was never executed. The mine was forced to be abandoned. The destruction of the mine caused the town of Roubaix to decline. In 1934, the mine reopened but closed again in 1935, when the Anaconda Gold Mining and Milling Company only mined $10,000 in gold. The land was sold to a private owner in 1937.\n\nLater history and today\nThe post office continued operation until the 1940s. The shaft house at the mine was destroyed during a windstorm in 1953, and the school was torn down in the 1960s. Today, there are only a few of the old houses left standing. The foundations of the mine can still be seen. The only remnants of the mills are a couple of bullwheels. However, the town still has a very small population. There are no businesses in the town.\n\nGeography\nRoubaix is in the Black Hills of western Lawrence County, at the coordinates . It is located on the east side of U.S. Route 385 along Elk Creek and is approximately seven miles south of Pluma.\n\nClimate\n\nReferences\n\nSee also \n Pierre Wibaux\n Roubaix\n\nExternal links \n\nUnincorporated communities in South Dakota\nUnincorporated communities in Lawrence County, South Dakota\nMining communities in South Dakota", "instruction": " What significant events occurred in Roubaix, South Dakota after the mine closure in 1935?"}

{"topic": "French Battalion", "document": "The French Battalion of the United Nations Organisation (, or BF-ONU) was a battalion of volunteers made up of active and reserve French military personnel sent to the Korean Peninsula as part of the UN force fighting in the Korean War.\n\nKorea\nLieutenant General Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, better known under his nom de guerre, Monclar, Inspector of the French Foreign Legion and a hero of World War II, supported Chief of Staff of the French Army General Clément Blanc's decision to form a volunteer force and agreed to command the new unit, accepting a demotion back to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. The French Battalion arrived in Pusan, South Korea on November 29, 1950, and was placed under the operational control of the U.S. 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. Despite initial fears about French forces being \"on the rout\", the battalion carried out several successful early actions and earned the respect of General Matthew Ridgway, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army.\n\nFrom January 7–12, 1951, the French Battalion participated in the First and Second Battle of Wonju where it stopped the North Korean advance. It was followed by the Battle of the Twin Tunnels (February 1–2, 1951) and of Chipyong-ni (February 3–16, 1951). These battles, during which the battalion resisted the attacks of four Chinese divisions for three days, allowed the 8th Army to score a victorious counter-offensive. Three weeks later, the battalion was engaged in combat for Hill 1037 (about 50 miles east of Seoul) and lost 40 dead and 200 wounded while attacking and capturing the hill.\n\nIn the spring of 1951, the battalion crossed the 38th parallel into the Hwacheon region. The destruction of an engineering platoon led to a partial rout of the French Battalion. However, it allowed U.S. forces to stop the new Chinese offensive. In the fall of 1951, the French took part in the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge. In the course of these combats which lasted a month, 60 French soldiers were killed and 200 were wounded. In the fall of 1952, after a lethal war of positions, similar to the Battle of Verdun during World War I, the battalion put a halt in Chongwon, South Korea, to a Chinese offensive toward Seoul. This resistance resulted in 47 dead and 144 wounded. The total Chinese losses against the French battalion were estimated at 2000 men. In the winter and the spring of 1953, the battalion took part in battles which kept the North Korean and Chinese forces from reaching Seoul.\n\nAfter the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in July 1953, the French Battalion left Korea with five French Citations to the Order of the Army; the French Fourragère in the colors of the Military Medal; two Korean Presidential Citations; and three American Distinguished Unit Citations. Forty-four of the French casualties were eventually buried at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, South Korea.\n\nIn an address to a joint session of the United States Congress on 22 May 1952, General Ridgway said the following:\n\nOne member of the French Battalion, Louis Misseri, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by the United States for his actions. His citation reads:\n\nPaul L. Freeman Jr., the commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, said of the French Battalion:\n\nPost Korea\n\nOn October 22, 1953, the French battalion embarked on the  and headed for Indochina, where it was expanded into a two battalion regiment and formed the nucleus of the French Groupement mobile 100.  During their service in Indochina, the unit (under its new title of Le Regiment de Corée) participated in the brutal Battle of Mang Yang Pass along Route coloniale 19 in June and July 1954, where it suffered heavy casualties.  Between its arrival in Indochina and the cease-fire on July 20, 1954, the 1st Battalion suffered 238 killed or wounded, and the 2nd Battalion 202 killed or wounded.  In addition, 34 Indochinese assigned to the battalion were killed in action.  On September 1, 1954, the Regiment de Corée was disbanded and reduced to battalion size.  The battalion remained in Indochina until July 17, 1955, when it embarked from Saigon to Algeria to participate in the suppression of the ongoing insurrection.\n\nOn August 10, 1955, the battalion landed in Algiers and began a series of garrison and search-and-destroy operations in the Constantine Department.  On September 1, 1960, the battalion was amalgamated with the 156th Infantry Regiment () and received the designation of 156 Régiment d'Infanterie- Régiment de Corée.  All told, the regiment suffered 48 killed in action in Algeria.  The regiment was repatriated to France after the Évian Accords and disbanded upon its return to France in 1962.\n\nSee also\n United Nations Forces in the Korean War\n Medical support in the Korean War\n Military history of France\n  French participation in the Korean War Forces françaises dans la guerre de Corée\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War-3 (Belgium, Colombia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1974 (E-BOOK) \n The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War-3 (Belgium, Colombia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1974 (PDF) \n The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War-6 (Summary) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1977 (E-BOOK) \n The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War-6 (Summary) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1977 (PDF) \n\n The Korean War and the UN Forces - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 2015 (E-BOOK)  \n The Korean War and the UN Forces - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 2015 (PDF)  \n The Statistics of the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 2014 (E-BOOK)  \n The Statistics of the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 2014 (PDF)  \n The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1998 (E-BOOK)  \n The History of the UN Forces in the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1998 (PDF)  \n The Summary of the Korean War - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1986 (PDF)  \n The History of the Korean War-10:  The UN Forces (Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Netherlands) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1980 (E-BOOK)  \n The History of the Korean War-10: The UN Forces (Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Netherlands) - ROK Ministry of National Defense Institute for Military History, 1980 (PDF)\n\nExternal links\n\nFrench Army \"Docrine\" Magazine #11, April 2007 article called The UN-Assigned French Battalion in Korea\nFrench Participation in the Korean War\nUN Participation in the Korean War – Korean War Educator\n Souvenirs de Corée avec le Bataillon Français de l'O.N.U. \n\nInfantry battalions of France\nMilitary units and formations of the First Indochina War\nMilitary history of France during the Korean War\nFrench Fourth Republic\nFrance\nMilitary units and formations established in 1950\nMilitary units and formations disestablished in 19", "instruction": " What was the specific reason behind the destruction of the French Battalion's engineering platoon in the spring of 1951, leading to a partial rout and allowing U.S. forces to stop a new Chinese offensive?"}
{"topic": "Ground rent", "document": "As a legal term, ground rent specifically refers to regular payments made by a holder of a leasehold property to the freeholder or a superior leaseholder, as required under a lease. In this sense, a ground rent is created when a freehold piece of land is sold on a long lease or leases. The ground rent provides an income for the landowner. In economics, ground rent is a form of economic rent meaning all value accruing to titleholders as a result of the exclusive ownership of title privilege to location.\n\nHistory\nIn Roman law, ground rent (solarium) was an annual rent payable by the lessee of a superficies (a piece of land), or perpetual lease of building land.\nIn early Norman England, tenants could lease their title to land so that the land-owning lords did not have any power over the sub-tenant to collect taxes. In 1290 King Edward I passed the Statute of Quia Emptores that prevented tenants from leasing their lands to others through subinfeudation. This created a system of substitution, where the tenant's full interest would be transferred to the purchaser or donee, who would pay a rentcharge. This system later passed into common law in England and was adopted by many nations which trace their legal heritage to England.\n\nClassical economists and Georgists quantify ground rent to investigate and capture unearned income called economic rent, as distinct from income derived from labour.\n\nValuation\n\nThe value of the freehold interest comprises:\n\n A multiple of the current annual ground rent payable, which will depend on\n the outstanding term of the lease\n any future scheduled increases in the level of ground rent\n market interest rates\n the probability of default\n if the rents for individual flats etc. are small, the cost of collection\n The net present value of the reversion, i.e. at the end of the lease the freeholder (to whom the rent is paid) will probably be fully entitled to the property, so the shorter the lease the greater the reversion value.\n Any attributable \"marriage value\" (a substantial sum designed to compensate freeholders for their loss of interest when a lease with less than 80 years to run is extended).\n\nIn economics, ground rent means all economic value accruing to owners of land, regardless of whether payments are explicitly made or the rents are imputed.  Various assessment methodologies are employed by real estate appraisers.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the rights of residential tenants of property subject to a long lease at a ground rent are governed by the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 for houses and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 for flats.\n\nEngland and Wales\n\nIn English law, it appears that the term \"ground rent\" was at one time popularly used for the houses and lands out of which ground rents issue, as well as for the rents themselves. Lord Eldon observed in 1815 that the context in which the term occurred may materially vary its meaning.\n\nThe contemporary accepted meaning of ground rent is the rent at which land is let for the purpose of improvement by building: i.e. a rent charged in respect of the land only, and not in respect of the buildings to be placed on it. It is therefore usually lower than the rent that might be achieved for a building let on the open market, and is let for a longer termat least 21 years, but more commonly 99 years, 125 years, or even 999 years.\n\nThe Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 and associated regulations now govern the form of notice that needs to be issued to collect ground rent. Previously there had been a problem with some landlords sending confusing or dishonest demands for payments to tenants.\n\nUnder the terms of a lease agreement, the freeholder (the outright owner of the land or property) grants permission for a leaseholder to take ownership of the property for a specified period of time. This could range from 21 years to 999 years, and during this time, the leaseholder will pay ground rent to the freeholder. Freeholders lease property primarily for the initial premium paid by the original leaseholder for granting the lease; but in addition ground rent (often a token amount) will be payable over a long term, and this may be an attractive fixed income investment for some types of investor. The final sanction available to a landlord faced with a leaseholder in breach of the lease due to the failure to pay the service charges, ground rent or administration charges, is to forfeit the lease and to repossess the house or flat. To do this the landlord must first serve a valid notice under section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 – a Notice of Seeking Possession. However, the landlord cannot serve a section 146 notice where the amount of service charges, administration charges or ground rent owed (or a combination of all of these) unless the unpaid amount is more than £350 or consists of, or includes, an amount that has been outstanding for more than three years.\n\nThere are a number of companies which specialise in buying ground rents for long term investment from landlords who want to sell their ground rents. Normally they focus on purchasing reversionary ground rents, either for initial income or for the opportunity of a reversion of the underlying property at some point in the future. The value of ground rents is affected by the rent review pattern on future income increases, the value of the underlying property, the unexpired lease length, and whether marriage value is applicable.\n\nBefore selling ground rents, statute obliges the transactional parties to serve Section V notices on the long leaseholders. This gives them a two-month period in which to respond. Upon expiry of this, a transaction can proceed within 12 months at the price stated on the notice or higher. The only case in which such notices are irrelevant is for exchange of contracts on the sale and purchase of the ground rent of flats before 50% of them were sold. This then allows for the sum to pass and ground rent rights in return, even after all the flats are sold, without individual notices. However the rentcharge buyer is wise to note the pending contract on the freehold title.\n\nBefore 2003 the Land Registry recorded the ground rent, and the rent is evident from the register of title from their website. From 13 October 2003 the Land Registry no longer does so, and a more studied examination of the downloaded lease is needed.\n\nGround rent scandal \nIn the past, ground rent was usually not onerous, at typically around £100 per year, and often freeholders would not request payment. But in the 2010s, developers and builders often granted leases for new homes with ground rents as high as £1000 per annum, with escalation clauses doubling them every 5 or 10 years. This can result in immediate and/or subsequent mortgage refusals from lenders and their valuers, which makes the property sellable below the market price.\n\nLeaseholders have a right after two years to extend a lease with less than 99 years to run and reduce ground rent to a \"peppercorn\", i.e. close to zero, but developers have thwarted this with costly leases of more than 150 years that make the valuation – based on the ground rent and term – beyond the reach of leaseholders, and sell the freehold – often before the development is finished – to exploitative offshore companies.\n\nThe English and Welsh \"ground rent scandal\" has been widely reported in the press. In 2016 MP Peter Bottomley described excessive ground rents as \"legalised extortion\". In response to questions raised by the MP, communities secretary Sajid Javid said: \"We must make sure the kind of abuses he mentioned are stamped out and we will continue to do everything [we can]. We do work with a number of stakeholders and we can certainly see how we can do more.\"\n\nIn June 2018 the UK government announced that leasehold tenure would be reformed, with new long leases having zero ground rent. This promise was fulfilled with the Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022, which mostly prohibited ground rent greater than one peppercorn per year on new leases.\n\nScotland\n\nIn Scots law, the term 'ground rent' is not employed, but its place is taken, for practical purposes, by the ground annual, which bears a double meaning:\n At the time of the Reformation in Scotland, the lands of the Church were parcelled out by the Crown into various lordships, the grantees being called \"Lords of Erection\". In the 17th century these Lords of Erection resigned their superiorities to the Crown, with the exception of the feu-duties, which were to be", "instruction": " What is the typical length of a ground lease in the United States?"}

{"topic": "Blackstone Library", "document": "T. B. Blackstone Memorial Library is a building that is part of the Chicago Public Library System and is named after Timothy Blackstone.  The building was designed by Chicago architect Solon S. Beman.  It is now known as the Chicago Public Library – Blackstone Branch and commonly referred to as Blackstone Library, or Blackstone Branch and sometimes Blackstone for short.  The Concord Granite building's two-year construction started in 1902, and it was dedicated on January 8, 1904. Blackstone Library marks the beginning of the Chicago Branch Library System as the first dedicated branch in the system. Blackstone is also the only branch of the 79-branch Chicago Public Library branch system that was constructed using private funding. The Blackstone Library was designated as a Chicago Landmark.\n\nThe building is located in Chicago's Kenwood community area in Cook County, Illinois, United States and serves the Hyde Park, Kenwood, and Oakland community areas.  The branch celebrated its 100th anniversary of service in 2004. Today, the library has bronze and mahogany furnishings and has themed paintings on the rotunda ceiling.  The library is equipped with custom-designed furniture and makes public Wi-Fi access available to its patrons.\n\nHistory\n\nThe library was dedicated to the memory of Timothy Beach Blackstone, President of the Chicago and Alton Railroad from 1864 to 1899, a period longer than any of his contemporaries. Blackstone, who had died on May 26, 1900, was also the founding president of the Union Stock Yards. He had owned the property on which the Blackstone Library now stands, and he donated this tract for the construction of the library after his death.  The library was built on the tract through a codicil in his will, carried out by his wife, Isabella Norton Blackstone (1838–1928), after his death. Blackstone Library was his contribution to the city where he had made his fortune and stands as a monument to his generosity. Blackstone is  and its original cost was $250,000 ($ today).\n\nAlthough the Blackstones lived downtown, they maintained numerous close friendships in the affluent Hyde Park and Kenwood neighborhoods. Prior to the donation of the Blackstone Library, the Chicago Public Library System had been renting reading room spaces around the city and had been seeking stand alone branches. On January 8, 1904, Isabella Blackstone handed the keys and deed to the Timothy B. Blackstone Library to the city's Library Board members.  Blackstone Library became the first branch library in the Chicago Public Library System. The building retains a Lake Park Avenue address although the neighboring section of Lake Park was moved about a half a block east several decades ago.\n\nAt least three renovations have occurred, which have expanded, renovated and updated the library. From 1938 to 1939 the new children's room annex, a Works Progress Administration project, was added at a cost of $68,400 ($). During this annexation one of a set of Howard Van Doren Shaw townhouses was razed. From 1977 to 1980 a major restorative renovation occurred. Blackstone was rededicated on November 18, 1980, in recognition of completion of the three years of work. There was also a 2004 renovation for the centennial.\n\nBlackstone donated a larger James Blackstone Memorial Library (1891, opened 1893), in his father's memory to Branford, Connecticut, Blackstone's birthplace.  In addition to the James Blackstone Library in Branford, there is a library named \"Blackstone Library\" in Blackstone, MA. The architect for both the Branford and Chicago libraries was Solon S. Beman. The Blackstone Library was designated as a Chicago Landmark by the City of Chicago on December 8, 2010.\n\nService\n\nAs one of the 79 Chicago Public Library branch libraries, Blackstone Library serves the Hyde Park, Kenwood, and Oakland community areas.  These communities include 17 elementary schools and 4 high schools. The 2000 census service area population was 50,084.\n\nIn 2003, the \"Friends of Blackstone Branch Library\" was formed, making the Blackstone Branch one of approximately 34 branches to have such a support group.  The volunteer support group attempts to \"serve as an advisory council for Chicago's first branch library, promote use and improvement of the library, and provide volunteer and fundraising services for Blackstone\".\n\nThe Blackstone Library participates in most Chicago Public Library programs and partnerships, including Great Kids Museum Passport Program, the Monthly Adult Book Club Discussion as well as many annual events and activities. The branch also partners with neighborhood institutions such as the Hyde Park Art Center and the Smart Museum for programs and workshops.  Like all branches, the library provides both free Wi-Fi access and free terminals with both internet access and printing facilities.  Blackstone has 5 internet terminals requiring reservations for each session of up to one hour and 1 express terminal that does not require reservations for sessions of up to 15 minutes.  Currently, patrons can use the terminals for up to two free internet sessions per day and print for a small charge per page anywhere in the Chicago Public Library system.\n\nDesign\n\nThe building was designed by the architect Solon S. Beman and modeled after Beman's Merchant Tailors Building, the domed temple facing the lagoon in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and the Erechtheum at the Athenian Acropolis. Greek Mythology teaches that Demeter, the goddess, bestowed agriculture and civilization upon the world during Erechtheus's reign. The library's rotunda murals have thematic titles: \"Labor\", \"Literature\", \"Art\" and \"Science\".\n\nThe following is a summary of the building's features: Tiffany style dome; Marble column and walls in the rotunda and foyer; 4 overhead rotunda murals painted by Oliver Dennett Grover, mural painter for the World Columbian Exposition;  square Italian marble mosaic flooring; glass-floored mezzanine;  bronze plate, solid copper core outer front doors; 2  lbs. bronze and glass inner doors;  thick granite walls; and ionic columns.\n\nThe building's adult reading room is equipped with mahogany furniture specifically designed for the space. It also contains matching built-in shelving and custom-made bronze lamps. The circulation desk area has two-tiered bronze-trimmed book stacks. The mezzanine floor is composed of glass blocks.\n\nRelated structures and ways\n\nAlthough parts of South Blackstone Avenue south of 53rd Street accommodate two-way traffic, near the library it is a northbound street that accommodates one-way traffic running north along the 1436 east block and ending immediately to the west of (behind) the Blackstone Library at 4900 south (see Kenwood map in external links below and picture to the right).  The street was also named after Timothy Blackstone well after the library was built. The Blackstone Library does not bear a Blackstone Avenue address, despite its proximity. Blackstone Hotel and adjacent Blackstone Theatre (now the Merle Reskin Theatre) would also be named after Timothy Blackstone, whose mansion had stood on their site.\n\nGallery\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\nTimothy Beach Blackstone biography and genealogy \nChicago Public Library – Blackstone Branch (official website)\nOfficial City of Chicago Building information\nOfficial City of Chicago Kenwood Community Map\n\nChicago Landmarks\nLibrary buildings completed in 1904\nPublic libraries in Chicago\nSolon Spencer Beman buildings\nWorks Progress Administration in Illinois\nLibraries established in 1904", "instruction": " What significant events took place during the major restorative renovation of Blackstone Library between 1977 and 1980?"}

In 1940, the Bund absorbed a number of tiny Nazi-supporting organisations to become the NBS under Henne and Dr. Max Leo Keller. Other groups absorbed included the  and elements of the National Front. The new group also officially bore the French-language name Mouvement Nationale Suisse as an appeal to Francophone Swiss. Keller had worked with Heinrich Himmler and brought with him Andreas von Sprecher, whom the  SS had trained, to run the new group's propaganda department.\n\nKeller, Jakob Schaffner and Ernst Hofmann, as representatives of the NBS, received an audience with the Swiss President Marcel Pilet-Golaz (in office throughout 1940) in which they demanded much closer relations with Nazi Germany, leading to eventual incorporation. This was followed by a Munich conference in October 1940 to which the Director of the Reich Security Main Office, Reinhard Heydrich and the Swiss doctor and SS-member Franz Riedweg invited the leaders of the NBS and of other Swiss groups in order to increase cohesion. Ultimately the meeting strengthened the hand of the NBS, as the remnants of the Bund Treuer Eidgenossen Nationalsozialistischer Weltanschauung as well as the Eidgenössische Soziale Arbeiter-Partei and Ernst Leonhardt's Nationalsozialistische Schweizerische Arbeitspartei agreed to be absorbed into the movement.\n \nDespite this strengthening the National Movement did not last long, as the Swiss Federal Council feared that annexation by Germany was just around the corner. In a series of moves against the most extreme groups, the NBS was closed down on 19 November 1940, by which time it had 160 cells and around 4000 members. The group continued to work underground for a time before a police crackdown which led to most of the leadership fleeing to Germany. Whilst in Germany Keller set up the Bund der Schweizer Nationalsozialisten as an émigré movement, although its influence remained limited; eventually he returned to Switzerland in 1941. Meanwhile, various NBS units continued underground activity secretly, mostly with help from the SS, until World War II ended in 1945.\n\nSee also\nFranz Burri\n\nExternal links\n\nDefunct political parties in Switzerland\nNazi parties\nPolitical parties established in 1940\nBanned far-right parties", "instruction": " What were the specific reasons why the Swiss Federal Council closed down the National Movement of Switzerland in 1940?"}

{"topic": "WarCry Network", "document": "WarCry Network (or WarCry.com per the URL) was a web portal centered on the MMO (massively multiplayer online) genre of video games. It boasted a large community of professional web sites and databases for these games. One of the regular features at WarCry.com were exclusive interviews with game developers and game company executives.\n\nPreviously associated closely with its sister site The Escapist, WarCry was deactivated in late 2018 during the liquidation of its owner, Defy Media.\n\nHistory\nThe company known as WarCry Corp. was started in 1997 by Alexander Macris. Originally a developer and publisher of online games, in 2001 WarCry acquired the assets of Crossroads Gaming Network (also known as XRGaming) in an undisclosed private transaction. The merged company took the WarCry name, but dropped the online gaming angle to concentrate on more coverage of games, particularly massively multiplayer which had been XRGaming's stock in trade. Whilst popular, XRGaming had been suffering in the midst of the dot-com bust and WarCry's funding enabled both to survive.\n\nThemis Group \nMacris and Thomas Kurz founded Themis Group in August 2001 as a consulting firm for MMOG developers. Initially, Themis and WarCry were considered separate by Macris, who had sold his stake in WarCry.\n\nOn July 12, 2005, Themis launched The Escapist, a weekly online magazine with Macris taking the role of publisher. By 2007, WarCry and The Escapist began using the same web software and similar layouts throughout their parallel life cycle. During this time, the company was split into two divisions: TAP Interactive, a continuation of the consulting firm; and Themis Media, an umbrella division for the websites.\n\nOn October 6, 2008, Themis Group announced they would be consolidating TAP Interactive into Themis Media, thus putting all their efforts into WarCry and The Escapist.\n\nAcquisition and Decline \nThemis Group was purchased by Alloy Digital (later Defy Media) in 2012.\n\nWhile The Escapist was purchased by Enthusiast Gaming in July 2018, the deal did not include WarCry. With the closure of Defy Media in November 2018, WarCry was taken offline.\n\nCoverage\nThe WarCry Network specialized in covering numerous popular MMOGs. The network itself had numerous daughter sites dedicated to covering almost all aspects of the games it covers. It has specific database pages for no less than 29 different online games, including extremely popular games such as World of Warcraft, Everquest 2, Lineage II, City of Heroes and even the aging Dark Age of Camelot. The WarCry network now covers games, movies, anime, comics and other parts of the entertainment industry, supplied by a network of contributors and user-submitted content. Similar to many print gaming magazines, the WarCry network conducted its own \"Editor's Choice Awards\" in 2006.\n\nSome of their contemporaries included TenTonHammer.com, IGN's Vault Network, Stratics and the Coldfront Gaming Network.\n\nImpact\nMany gaming news sites index and/or link to articles that were originally published on WarCry. Some of the editorials published on the network have been used as sources by other articles as well. Many of their interviews with game developers have been referenced to by other online news sites.\n\nSome official game websites have considered the network significant enough so as to reference them on their official websites. For example, Lineage II's news site stated that WarCry had exclusive coverage of their \"Lineage II Battle Tournament\". Paris-based NEVRAX, makers of the massively-multiplayer online game The Saga of Ryzom, has also mentioned the WarCry Network in an official press release, alongside notable industry news sources such as GameSpy and Computer Gaming World.\n\nIn light of their 2006 Editor's Choice Awards, many game developers have also acknowledged the network on their own official websites. Cryptic Studios, makers of the massively multiplayer City of Heroes and Marvel Universe Online games referenced their Editor's Choice Award on their official news site. Another major MMOG, EVE Online, acknowledged WarCry for naming their Revelations expansion, \"Expansion of the Year\" on their front page.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWarcry Network Official Site\n\nVideo game fansites\nInternet properties established in 1997\nInternet properties disestablished in 2018\n\nde:WarCry", "instruction": " What major events or developments occurred after WarCry was purchased by Defy Media in 2012 that may have contributed to its eventual demise?"}

Memo has collected all the money he needs, to marry the woman he loves (Cano). Unfortunately the whole village (especially his mother, Cano, and the leader of the village called Ağa) want him to kill the murderer of his father, but the man is still in jail. Memo persuades the village by saying, that if the murderer of his father comes out of jail, then he will fulfill his duty.\n\nAt the day of the wedding, the murderer of Memo´s father (Sülo) comes out of jail. Now the villages is waiting for Memo to kill his enemy and revenge his father, yet Memo does not want to kill a human being, even if he had killed his father. Memo and Sülo decide to scam the village, by staging Sülo's death. Unfortunately this ends in Memo being charged by murder, because everyone believed, that Sülo died of Memo's hand.\n\nOn the way to jail, Memo and Sülo are on the same bus, which is later on stopped and robbed by bandits. The leader of the bandits (Bekiro) recognises Memo and takes him to their hiding place in the mountains, so that he don´t have to go to jail. Also does Bekiro take Sülo, because Memo pities him. \nAs time goes by Memo develops into a real bandit, while Sülo only does the dishes and receives no money, gold or other valuable objects. One day, Memo sees Bekiro who puts money into an almost full vase in between bushes and says it to Sülo, who tries to persuade him into stealing the vase and getting rich. Yet Memo does not want to betray his old friend. After a while Bekiro cannot stand the loneliness and sadness of Memo due to his separation (the police taking him away) with his wife and decides to infiltrate the village and to bring Memo and Cano together.\n\nAt that day, the whole bandit group is killed by the police, who found out, that the bandit´s came down to the village, except Memo. He is taken away again by the police, for the \"murder\" of Sülo. While Memo is in jail, Sülo tries to get him out of there, so that Memo can show him where the Bekiro´s vase full with money an other valuable items is. Sülö´s plan works, he smuggles Memo out of jail and they get the vase. The next step is to go to İstanbul, because Memo is still wanted in his village and around. \nAfter they get there suspiciousness evolves between Memo and Sülo, because of the money. However Sülo accomplishes to steal the whole money from Memo and runs away. Memo now has to work hard to live, while Sülo is spending the money on expensive evenings with food and women. Afterwards Memo finds Sülo in an establishment and takes him with the money to his hotel room to punish him. Later Memo gets a letter in which Cano has written, that the Ağa will marry Sülo´s wife, who technically is a widow, because of Sülo´s \"death\". Sülo cannot stand the idea of his wife marrying another man. He decides to go to the village and kidnap his wife, but Memo is against it, because then the whole village will find out, that he was not man enough to kill his father´s murderer. Still. Sülo manages to get through Memo to the village.\n\nAt the village, Sülo tries to kidnap his wife but he fails. Right at that point, Memo comes and finds out, that the only reason why the Ağa said, that he has to kill his father´s murderer is, because he wanted to marry his wife. Yet Memo is furious and wants to kill his enemy until Sülo´s wife tells him, that she is pregnant. Memo empathises with her and her unborn child, due to himself being only brought up by his mother.

Several rulers, namely the then king of Manipur and the Khasi tribal chief (Viryyavanta), submitted to Chilaray. Chilaray and his army also vanquished and killed the Jaintia king, and kings of Tippera (Tripura) and Sylhet.

He was harsh to kings and soldiers who refused to surrender, but neither him nor his brother ever annexed territories or oppressed the common people. They only collected tributes from the vanquished kings. They even treated enemy prisoners kindly, and gave them land-grants to settle.\n\nThe duo (Chilaray and Nara Narayan) turned towards Bengal, but unforeseen circumstances led to Chilaray's capture by the Afghan Sultan Sulaiman Khan Karrani, while Naranarayan retreated to his capital.

It plays its home games at San Pablo.\n\nHistory \nClub Deportivo de Baloncesto Sevilla was founded in 1987 when the team bought the seat of Dribling de Madrid in the second division, in that time called Primera División B. In 1989, the team promoted to Liga ACB for the first time ever.\n\nIn 1996 and 1999 the club finished the league as runner-up being defeated both times in the finals 0–3 by FC Barcelona.\n\nIn 2011, Sevilla lost the 2010–11 Eurocup final, played in Treviso, Italy, against Unics Kazan.\n\nOn 21 July 2016, Baloncesto Sevilla and Real Betis agreed a collaboration agreement for helping the football squad to solve the financial problems of the basketball team. The team would be called Real Betis Energía Plus as a result of the agreement and a new sponsor. On 31 December 2016, Real Betis agreed the buy of the 99.99% of the shares of the club and implemented it on 12 January 2017.\n\nIn 2017 the club relegated from Liga ACB for the first time in its history, but remained in the league in application of the precautionary measures issued by the judicial demand of the Andalusian club after the change of the requirements to join the ACB during the pre-season. However, the club was relegated again in the next season after a very poor performance with only seven wins in 34 matches, finishing in the last position of the league table.\n\nOn 6 September 2018, the club unanimously approved to take the necessary steps to obtain the pertinent authorization from the Spanish royal house to change its name to Real Betis Baloncesto S.A.D. This change was finally approved on 15 December 2018.\n\nDuring the 2018–19 season, their first ever in LEB Oro, Real Betis beat the record of biggest winning streak with 17, thus meaning they beat all their league opponents consecutively.

{"topic": "Long-Range Aviation", "document": "Long-Range Aviation (, literally Aviation of Distant Action and abbreviated DA, is a sub-branch of the Russian Aerospace Forces responsible for delivering long-range nuclear or conventional strikes by aircraft (rather than missiles). The branch was previously part of the Soviet Air Forces and Russian Air Force tasked with long-range bombardment of strategic targets with nuclear weapons. \n\nDuring the Cold War, the Long-Range Aviation of the Air Forces (DA VS) was the rough Soviet equivalent to the French Air Force's Forces aériennes stratégiques (1964-present); the British RAF Bomber Command (1936-68); and the United States Air Force (USAF) Strategic Air Command (1946-1992). In the early 2020s there are roughly-equivalent structures within the People's Liberation Army Air Force and in the USAF Air Force Global Strike Command.\n\nLong-Range Aviation traces its history to the Aviation of Distant Action, AДД, or ADD, Авиация дальнего действия, and the 18th Air Army of the Second World War and beforehand. This article sketches the development of Soviet and Russian long-range bomber forces from their origins in the mid-1930s.\n\nOrigins, 1936-1940 \nThe first three Air Armies, designated Air Armies of Specific Purpose (or Particular Purpose) were created between 1936 and 1938.\n\nIn accordance with the predominant Deep operations doctrine, the Red Army was reorganized into six echelons, of which the long-range aviation was the 1st echelon. The 2nd echelon consisted of: heavy tanks; the 3rd echelon: medium and light tanks; the 4th echelon: the motorised infantry; the 5th echelon: heavy artillery; and the 6th echelon comprised the Main Force: the rifle troops, with their own integral tank support.\n\nThe 1st Specific Purpose Air Army was formed on 8 January 1936 as 1st Air Army of the General Reserve Command (Specific Purpose Army - 1) (1-я авиационная армия резерва главного командования (РГК) (АОН – 1)) headquartered at Monino Airfield. The initial TO&E established by the General Staff included two heavy-bomber air brigades (of Tupolev TB-3), one fast-bomber air brigade (of Tupolev SB) and one fighter air brigade. As the Ilyushin DB-3 entered service, they formed long-range bomber squadrons.\n\nThe 2nd Air Army was created on 15 March 1937 in the Far East, headquartered in Khabarovsk. The 3rd Air Army was created on 21 May 1938 in the North Caucasus Military District, headquartered in Rostov-on-Don.\n\nOn 20 October 1939 the three air armies' order of battle included:\n\n 1st Specific Purpose Army (Monino)\n 27th Aviation Brigade at Monino (9th Air Base)\n 21st and the 53rd Long Range Bomber Air Regiments\n 13th Aviation Brigade at Migalovo (24th Air Base)\n 41st Fast Bomber Air Regiment and\n 6th Long Range Bomber Air Regiment at Ivanovo (12th Air Base)\n 2nd Specific Purpose Army (Voronezh)\n 64th Aviation Brigade at Voronezh (112th Air Base)\n 7th and the 42nd Long Range Bomber Air Regiments\n 30th Aviation Brigade at Kursk (115th Air Base)\n 51st Fast Bomber Air Regiment and\n 45th Long Range Bomber Air Regiment at Oryol (141st Air Base)\n 3rd Specific Purpose Army (Rostov-on-Don)\n 3rd Aviation Brigade at Rostov-on-Don (12th Air Base)\n 1st Heavy Bomber Air Regiment and \n 12th Long Range Bomber Air Regiment at Novocherkassk (7th Air Base)\n 7th Aviation Brigade at Zaporizhia (16th Air Base)\n 8th and 11th Long Range Bomber Air Regiments\n\nOn 5 November 1940 the three Specific Purpose Air Armies were disbanded, due to their poor combat performance during the Winter War with Finland.\n\nThe three armies were restructured as an integrated: Long-Range Bomber Aviation of the Stavka, the Red Army supreme command (Дальнебомбардировочная авиация Главного командования Красной Армии (ДБА ГК)). The structure now comprised: five air corps, three separate air divisions and one separate air regiment.\n\nSecond World War \nThe crews of the DBA GK performed their first combat sorties on June 22, 1941, bombing enemy troop concentrations in the Suwalki and Przemysl areas. On June 23, long-range bombers together with Soviet naval aviation bombed Danzig, Koenigsberg, Warsaw, Krakow, and Bucharest. On the night of August 10-11 of the same year, naval aviation bombers of the Baltic Fleet and 81st Heavy Bomber Aviation Division DBA GK launched an air strike on the capital of the Reich, the city of Berlin.\n\nIn the difficult initial period of the war, the centralized control principal of the DBA GK was violated, large losses of aircraft and crews, and formations were constantly reorganised. The forces of the DBA of the Red Army Civil Code were divided into small groups, as a result, 74% of all aircraft sorties were lone rangers, for 1941, were produced with the aim of directly supporting the troops on the battlefield, which was not the force's main purpose.\n\nIn August 1941, the Supreme High Command had to abolish the corps link command and control from the DBA GK, since the loss of forces reached 65% of the original composition in June of the same year, and in the Active Army only seven air divisions remained. The state of affairs in the DBA GK, by the beginning of 1942, left much to be desired, therefore, in order to preserve the forces of the DBA GK, centralize their control, and ensure their massive use by the VGK, they decided and created Long-Range Aviation (ADD), as a separate branch of the Air Force, by the decree of the State Defence Committee, dated March 5, 1942 in order to carry out strategically important tasks:\n bombing strikes on administrative-political and military targets deep behind enemy lines;\n Violations of enemy transport communications;\n destruction of warehouses in the near rear;\n Bombardment of the enemy on the front line to support strategic operations.\n\nIn addition, the ADD (including the Civil Air Fleet, GVF, which is part of it) was widely used to provide partisan movement both on occupied territory of the USSR, and in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Poland, and performing special tasks, such as delivery of intelligences, reconnaissance and reconnaissance and sabotage groups, providing assistance to the Resistance in Axis-occupied Europe and many others.\n\nFormations of the ADD were allocated from the Red Army Air Force directly subordinate to The Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (SVGK). Eight long-range bomber Aviation Division, several airfields with a hard surface were transferred to long-range aviation, and a control, recruitment, logistics and repair system independent of the Red Army Air Force was created.\n\nLong-range aviation at that time consisted of more than 1300 TB-3, TB-7 and IL-4 bombers.\n\nIn 1941, LRA headquarters moved into the Petrovsky Palace in Moscow. \n\nOn 5 March 1942, Stavka reorganized the Long-Range Bomber Aviation as an autonomous force: the Long-Range Aviation (Авиация дальнего действия (АДД)), under the command of Alexander Golovanov. The force remained directly subordinate to Stavka and independent of the mainstream", "instruction": " What were the specific factors that led to the creation of the Long-Range Aviation (LRA) as a separate branch of the Soviet Air Force during World War II?"}
{"topic": "Medellín Cartel", "document": "The Medellín Cartel () was a powerful and highly organized Colombian drug cartel and terrorist organization originating in the city of Medellín, Colombia, that was founded and led by Pablo Escobar. It is often considered to be the first major \"drug cartel\" and was referred to as such; (a cartel) due to the organization's upper echelons and overall power-structure being built on a partnership between multiple Colombian traffickers operating alongside Escobar. Included were Jorge Luis Ochoa Vásquez, Fabio Ochoa Vásquez, Juan David Ochoa Vásquez, José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha and Carlos Lehder. Escobar's main partner in the organization however was his cousin Gustavo Gaviria who handled much of the cartel's shipping arrangements and the more general and detailed logistical aspects of the cocaine trafficking routes and international smuggling networks which were supplying at least 80% of the world's cocaine during its peak. Gustavo, also known as León seems to have also had a strong hand in the cartel's unprecedented acts of narcoterrorism, right alongside his cousin Pablo and was considered to be second in command of the cartel and therefore one of Colombia's most wanted men, with both him and Escobar having arrest warrants pending from other nations where their criminal activity had spread to, such as in Spain and the U.S. Meanwhile, Pablo Escobar's brother Roberto Escobar acted as the organization's accountant. The cartel operated from 1976 to 1993 in Colombia (Antioquia), Bolivia, Panama, Central America, Peru, the Bahamas, the United States (namely in cities such as Los Angeles, New York and Miami), as well as in Canada.\n\nAlthough Escobar started profitably smuggling contraband by the early 1970s, the true beginnings of what would eventually become the notorious mafia-like organization itself officially turned to trafficking cocaine as their main contraband product by 1976, (largely through the assistance of Carlos Lehder and George Jung) which greatly influenced the infamous sociocultural cocaine boom phenomenon of late 70s and early 80s in the United States. This \"boom\" was noticeably demonstrated by the impact of the violent street crimes which characterized the Miami drug war due to the cartel's trafficking operations significantly increasing the drug's overall availability and access through these newly enhanced markets as well as the further complexified and proliferated distribution networks. At the height of its operations, the Medellín Cartel smuggled multiple tons of cocaine each week into countries around the world and brought in an upwards of US$200 million daily in drug profits, and thus billions per year. Additionally, despite being well-known for once dominating the international illicit cocaine trade (along with expanding it) throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the organization, particularly in its later years, was also noted for its use of violence for political aims (mainly in protest of judicial extradition to the U.S.) as demonstrated by their societally straining and volatile asymmetric war against the Colombian state itself, primarily in the form of bombings, kidnappings, indiscriminate murder of law enforcement and political assassinations. Many of the victims included non-combatants or random citizens as attempts to negotiate with the government using fear through unambiguous acts of terror.\n\nAt its height, (during the early 80s) the Medellín Cartel was recognized as being the largest drug-trafficking syndicate in the world, estimated to have been smuggling three times as much cocaine as their main competitor, the Cali Cartel, an international drug-trafficking organization based in the Valle del Cauca department of Colombia. However, some experts and U.S. government officials have claimed the opposite, or said that most data compiled during this period was potentially skewed since most of the national security-based focus was mostly centered on the Medellín organization specifically due its more ostentatious acts of violence and \"vindictive\" nature.\n\nRelations between the Medellín and Cali trafficking organizations\n\nTraditionally, Pablo and the Medellín Cartel originally had a strategic alliance and specific smuggling arrangement with the Cali Cartel \"godfathers\" Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela early on. This arrangement resulted in Medellín controlling the cocaine trade in Los Angeles, Cali controlling New York City, while both of them agreed to share Miami and Houston. Eventually however, a personal dispute between Escobar and one of the Cali Cartel leaders named Pacho Herrera surfaced over a disagreement on territory in one or more of these distribution hubs. Although the two organizations had scrimmages beforehand; by 1988 (supposedly after the Monaco Apartment bombing) the Medellín and Cali organizations became perpetual enemies, a feud which continued until Medellín's eventual demise in 1993. A demise which was largely due to the rise of the anti-Escobar \"vigilante\" group known as Los Pepes, which was officially formed in January of 1993. \"Los Pepes\" was a diminutive form of the phrase \"Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar\" (meaning: \"[Those] Persecuted by Pablo Escobar\"). The group was largely financed by the Cali Cartel and led by brothers Carlos and Fidel Castaño whom were right-wing paramilitary leading commanders that were actually once part of the Medellín Cartel. Los Pepe's tactics, which were stylized to reflect Escobar's own violent methods now turned against him, and which proved ultimately instrumental to the progressive defeat of the Medellín Cartel reign, was further accentuated by Pablo's accumulation of enemies within his own organization (helping to characterize the formation of Los Pepes), as well as Pablo's ongoing and relentless war against the Colombian government and American law-enforcement agencies; a combination of factors which cornered Escobar during the last year of his life, along with his quickly diminishing sphere of power as the now final and last-standing leader of his once dominant cartel.\n\nDuring the initial days of their mutual alliance however, before these intense conflicts; the Cali and Medellín groups each showcased differing philosophies over how to \"ameliorate\" their situations with the authorities. While the more 'businesslike' Orejuela brothers of Cali wanted to solve such legal issues through corruption, Escobar instead sought to do so mostly through violence and intimidation. Particularly when his (often minimal) attempts to bribe officials were not immediately accepted. Notably, Escobar and the Medellín crew also garnered a unique reputation, even in their earlier days for murdering not only those who crossed them, but oftentimes their immediate family members or other relatives as well, unless otherwise stipulated such as when Pablo's enemies \"turned themselves in\" instead of fleeing the region or pleading for protection from the authorities (many of whom were already compromised). This method of \"webbed\" violence resulting from one person's mistakes against Escobar was reportedly explained directly to American smuggler George Jung when he first met Pablo in 1978 moments after witnessing a man get shot in the chest after he \"voluntarily\" gave himself up to Escobar upon the knowledge that the man's entire family would be killed if he did not.\n\nWhile Pablo Escobar seemingly viewed fear through violence and extortion (threats) as an effective motivator and more straightforward measure, Cali leader Gilberto in particular thought violence should only be used as a last resort, considering it to be generally bad for business due to the practical understanding that; \"dead people do not pay what they owe\". The Cali Cartel leaders even required their employees to fill out \"application forms\"; elucidating their personal information, not necessarily for the sake of threats but rather for the purpose of thorough background checks and security. This included not just names and addresses of Cali Cartel hopefuls, but financial assets and personal possessions such as automobiles. The Orejuela brothers wanted to be seen as \"the Kennedys of Colombia\" while Escobar similarly dreamed of one day becoming president of the nation. When this failed however due to scandals over his criminal reputation, Escobar thereafter began a brutal; nearly decade-long terroristic campaign against the government from April of 1984 starting with the assassination of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla (Colombia's Minister of Justice who favored extradition), to April of 1993 with the massive 44", "instruction": " What was the exact cause of the breakdown of the strategic alliance between the Medellín and Cali Cartels and how long did it take for their enmity to fully develop?"}

{"topic": "Al-Habash", "document": "⇗\n \nAl-Habash (, , Sabaic: ḤBS²T) was an ancient region in the Horn of Africa situated in the northern highlands of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. The term continues to be used in the Middle east and surrounding regions in reference to modern-day Ethiopia and traveled to Europe where it took on the Latin form Abyssinia\n\nAlthough originally used to refer to the Ethio-Semitic language speaking Orthodox Christian population of modern day northern Ethiopia, in parts of the Middle East and South Asia the term Habshi would grow to encompass all East Africans irrespective of ethno-religious or regional backgroundss\n\nOrigin\nThe term derives from Semitic languages: Ge'ez: Ḥabäśät, first written in the vowelless Ge'ez Abjad as ሐበሠተ, romanized: ḤBŚT; Sabaean: ḤBS²T. One of the earliest known local uses of the term dates to the second or third century Sabaean inscription recounting the nəgus (\"king\") GDRT of Aksum and ḤBŠT. The Ezana Stone also has an early mention of HBŚT. The early Semitic term appears to refer to a group of peoples, rather than a specific ethnicity. The Al-Habash were known in Islamic literature as being rulers of a Christian kingdom, guaranteeing its a historical exonym for the Axumites of antiquity. In the modern day, variations of the term are used in Turkey, Iran, and the Arab World in reference to Ethiopia and as a pan-ethnic word in the west by the Amhara, Tigray, and Biher-Tigrinya of Eritrea and Ethiopia (see: Habesha peoples). The Turks created the province of Habesh when the Ottoman Empire conquered parts of the coastline of present-day Eritrea starting in 1557. During this, Özdemir Pasha took the port city of Massawa and the adjacent city of Arqiqo. Along with the neighboring Barbaroi (Berbers) of Barbara, the Habash are recorded in the 1st century Greek travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as engaging in extensive commercial trade with Egypt, among other areas. The document also relates a strong connection with the \"Frankincense Country\" in the Mahra region of modern Yemen and a symbiotic relationship with the ancient Sabaeans, with whom the Habash were allied.\n\nEtymology\nDue to the ancient nature of the term, the etymology and meaning of Al-Habash are unknown, but some scholars have defined it as being in reference to a fertile region \"plenty in olives.\" According to South Arabian expert Eduard Glaser, the Egyptian hieroglyphic referring to the people that they traded with in Punt as , \"the bearded ones\" is the origin of the name. Francis Breyer also believes the Egyptian demonym to be the source of the Semitic term.\n\nModern Usage\nA list of exonyms for the modern country of Ethiopia derived from the historical region include: Habaś - हबश (Hindi), Habeš (Czech), Habeşistan (Turkish), Habsha - حبشہ (Urdu), Həbəşistan (Azeri), and Khabash - חבש‎ (Hebrew).\n\nSee also\nEthiopian Empire\nEthiopian Highlands\nHabesha people\nHorn of Africa\n\nReferences\n\nHistorical regions\nHorn of Africa", "instruction": " What was the exact economic and political relationship between the Habash and the ancient Sabaeans mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea?"}

{"topic": "Pollokshaws F.C.", "document": "Pollokshaws Football Club was a Scottish football team, based in Pollokshaws, now part of Glasgow (at the time a separate burgh).\n\nHistory\n\nThe club was founded on 18 April 1884, at a meeting at the town hall, as a merger between the Pollok and Sir John Maxwell clubs; William M'Neil, the match secretary of the Maxwell, was kept on as match secretary for the new club.  The club was the second club with the Pollokshaws name, the original club lasting from 1876 to 1878.\n\nThe new club entered the Scottish Cup and the Renfrewshire Cup for the 1884–85 season.  In the former competition, the club received a bye in the first round, and after two draws against Southern of Greenock in the second, the club (in accordance with the competition's rules) was given a third-round place.  The club's run ended with a 4–0 defeat at Thornliebank.\n\nOne week after the Thornliebank defeat, Pollokshaws gained a measure of comfort with its equal biggest-ever win in competitive football, beating Houston Athletic 14–0 in the Renfrewshire Cup, but the club lost in the second round to Olympic of Paisley.\n\nFor some reason the club did not enter the 1885–86 Scottish Cup, only the Renfrewshire, losing again to Thornliebank.  Its best run in the Renfrewshire came in 1886–87, two wins (one of which was a splendid 5–3 win at St Mirren, coming from 3–2 down at half-time, despite injury reducing the side to 10 men, and having to play into a stiff wind) and a bye taking it into the quarter-finals, where the club took Abercorn to a replay; Abercorn went on to win the competition.  The club had some fervid support at the time - at Christmas 1886, after Abercorn had beaten Pollokshaws in the Renfrewshire Cup replay, two ironworkers were accused of assaulting a tramway car conductor who had \"made a disparaging remark\" about the club, and one was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment.\n\nThe club only won two ties in the main rounds of the Scottish Cup - another 14–0 win, this time against Carlton of Greenock, in 1888–89, and 3–1 against Dykebar the following year - and did not win through to the main rounds after the introduction of qualifying rounds in 1891–92, falling one round short in 1892–93.  Indeed, in the first qualifying round in 1891–92 the club suffered its biggest Cup defeat, 12–0 at Ayr, ten goals coming in the second half as the 'Shaws had to face an \"incessant downpour\".\n\nFrom 1889 to 1890, the club moved from the Renfrewshire FA to the Glasgow Football Association and started to enter the Glasgow Cup instead, but in seven entries only won one tie, 3–1 at Rutherglen in 1890–91 - the third 'Shaws goal provoking a \"free fight\" in the crowd, which \"did not interfere with the progress of the game\".\n\nThe lack of success meant that the club was overlooked for membership in either the Scottish League or the Scottish Football Alliance.  The club, therefore, got together with a number of others to found the Scottish Football Federation in 1891.  The competition lasted for two seasons, Pollokshaws finishing mid-table in both, recording three double-digit wins - 13–3 win over Burnbank Swifts in March 1892, 14–1 over Clydebank in November 1892, and 10–2 over Falkirk in January 1893 -  but the Federation closed at the end of the 1892–93 season.  The Federation had proved to be a financial drain, given the distances involved and the £5 guarantee for visiting sides, and the clubs agreed to dissolve the Federation to start a new, smaller, competition, for ten clubs, to be called the Scottish Football Combination; Pollokshaws was one of the seven clubs accepted.  However the Combination never started, as, after the Scottish League absorbed many of the Alliance members in its new Second Division, four of the six Combination clubs (Albion Rovers, Wishaw Thistle, Arthurlie, and Royal Albert) joined the Alliance instead.  A fifth club - Motherwell - joined the League itself.\n\nWithout a league competition, Pollokshaws withered. The club's last recorded competitive match, against Rangers in the 1893–94 Glasgow Cup, ended in an 11–0 defeat; its last recorded friendly match, at Vale of Leven in April 1894, ended in a 7–0 defeat. Pollokshaws entered both the Scottish Cup and Glasgow Cup in 1894–95 but withdrew from both before playing a tie, and the club was formally struck off before the 1895–96 season.\n\nColours\n\nThe club originally wore red jerseys and white knickerbockers, with a black and white hose.  In 1889 the club changed to red and white vertical stripes, with blue knickers.\n\nGrounds\n\nThe club originally played at Broom Park, Cowglen.   In 1889 the club moved to Maxwell Park.\n\nNickname\n\nThe media referred to the club as the 'Shaws, but also as the Queer Folk, taken from the nickname given to Flemish weavers who came to the area in the 17th century.\n\nExternal links\nScottish Cup results (NB: 1877–78 fixture relates to the earlier Pollokshaws club; also does not include the club's 1886–87 entry, which resulted in a first round walkover against Woodvale, and a 4–0 defeat to Johnstone in the second round)\nScottish Federation results\nRenfrewshire Cup results\nGlasgow Cup results\n\nReferences\n\nPollokshaws\nPollokshaws\nFootball clubs in Glasgow\nAssociation football clubs established in 1884\nAssociation football clubs disestablished in 1895\n1884 establishments in Scotland\n1895 disestablishments in Scotland\nFootball in Renfrewshire", "instruction": " What significant achievements did Pollokshaws Football Club have outside of the Scottish Cup and the Renfrewshire Cup?"}

It has been the largest opposition party in the country since 2013.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Albania was founded in 1990 as a strongly anti-communist party with the majority of its followers being from politically persecuted dissidents of the Communist dictatorial regime of Enver Hoxha. In international relations, it is an associate member of the European People's Party and a full member of International Democrat Union.\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation\nThe Democratic Party was founded on 12 December 1990 with major involvement from Avdyl Matoshi, Azem Hajdari, Sali Berisha and Gramoz Pashko, and Arben Imami, Edmond Budina, Eduart Selami, Genc Ruli, Merita Zaloshnja, Aleksandër Meksi involved only in the early stages of the formation of the party. It is the first opposition party in Albania after more than 45 years of a communist leadership. The party was created as an anti-communist movement.\n\n1991: First pluralist elections\nThe First Pluralist would be the first elections since 1923 to allow more than one Party. The Ruling Labour Party of Albania during the 1991 Elections had the biggest advantage during the election. Including the influence over the media. There was no opportunity for the Democratic party and other Anti-Communist parties in the election to influence the rural country side. The Democratic Party platform had promised the transformation of living standards through membership in the European Community, strong connection with the United States and other Western nations, Gastarbeiter in German factories abroad, and immediate steps towards a free-market economy. Which resulted in the Democratic Party coming in second place in results. The Democratic party would ultimately win in the next Election.\n\n1992: Second pluralist parliamentary presidential elections\nThe Democratic Party of Albania won the parliamentary elections of 22 March 1992, the second free and fair elections after many decades of mandatory and single communist party candidate elections. Sali Berisha its leader was elected as the second President of Albania, which at the time had executive powers, and Aleksandër Meksi as Prime Minister. Sali Berisha with significant contribution in the formation of the party, and Aleksandër Meksi with minor contribution. The second pluralist government of Albania governed by the Democratic Party and its leader was tasked with executing reforms to turn the country from a communist style everything in the hands of the government rule into a democratic country based in free markets, property rights, individual rights, and without interference of the government in the private lives of its citizens.\n\n1996 Presidential elections\nFour years after the second free and fair elections, new free and fair election in respect to the new Constitution of Albania adopted in 1991, conform other democratic western and European countries were due. The elections were held on 26 May 1996. The main and well known political leaders of the party that governed the Republic of Albania for more than 45 years, under a ruthless regime, were no longer a major participant in the election. However, the party itself and its new and less known leaders at the time of the former Labor Party, the main political party during the communist regime was reformed, changed its platform conform to other parties that held the same believes, mainly left-wing philosophies, conform democratic standards, and its name to the Socialist Party of Albania. It was the only serious opponent and challenger to the Democratic Party of Albania in the 26 May 1996 presidential elections. During these elections the international election observers were limited in numbers. The Democratic Party of Albania and its allies were able to win more than 71 seats in the parliament, on the Presidential Election of 26 May 1996, enough to form the majority and stay in government. Sali Berisha and Aleksandër Meksi respectively remained President and Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania, until new parliamentary election were called due to the Ponzi-Schemes crisis, held on 29 June 1997.\n\n1997 parliamentary elections\nThe Ponzi-Schemes lead to civil unrest that culminated in early spring of 1997. The crisis was deeply severe. The government led by the Democratic Party of Albania and its leader due to civil unrest was not able to function properly in many parts of the country, especially in the south of Albania. The fact that these Ponzi-Schemes were endorsed by the government (led by the Democratic Party of Albania) or suggested people to invest in these schemes and the majority of the people who invested in these Ponzi-Schemes blamed the Democratic Party's government for the failure of the Ponzi-Schemes. As a result of this crisis and internal civil unrest new parliamentary election were called on 29 June 1997 to sooth the situation. As a result of these elections the Democratic Party of Albania lost its elections to its opposition party, Socialist Party of Albania.\n\nA little more than a year after the Socialist Party of Albania took control of the government on 12 September 1998 Azem Hajdari one of the founding members of the Democratic Party of Albania and a very important political figure within the party was assassinated. His assassination lead to further unrest in Albania. The Democratic Party of Albania was in opposition and its leader, the former President of Albania (with executive powers), who was in the leadership of the party during this time, Sali Berisha, accused the government of the Socialist Party of Albania as the perpetrator of the assassination of Azem Hajdari.\n\n2001 parliamentary elections\nOn 24 June 2001 the next parliamentary elections on the due date as provided by the constitution were held. These elections were also lost by the Democratic Party of Albania although not as deeply as the previous elections. The Democratic Party alleged irregularities and did not accept the result of the elections. ODHIR and OSCE which were involved in monitoring the elections and as an independent party declared on their final report that the elections were marked by irregularities and that repeated voting in some electoral zones increased the violations and irregularities of the election. To what extent these irregularities and violations helped the Socialist Party of Albania win in such a wide range was not determined or conclusive in the election report.\n\n2005 parliamentary elections\nIn the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Party won 56 of the 140 seats and its allies won 18 under the call Time to Change (Koha per Ndryshim).

This meant that with a combined total of 79 seats, the Democratic Party and its allies were able to form a government with Sali Berisha becoming Prime Minister. One of his priorities was Albanian integration to NATO, an objective he accomplished in 2009 when Albania and Croatia were accepted as members.

It was one of 24 war memorials in England designed by Sir Herbert Baker, that were designated as a national collection by Historic England in 2017. The memorial is located near the gates of Hatfield House, and close to Hatfield railway station. It was unveiled in 1921, to commemorate 139 men from Hatfield killed on service during the First World War.  A brick pavilion records the names of the dead, with further names added after the Second World War.\n\nThe memorial comprises a Portland stone memorial cross, standing within a garden surrounded by brick walls to the north, west and south sides, and a yew hedge to the east, with an entrance gate in the wall to the south. Portland stone tablets with dedications listing the names of the dead are located in a brick shelter pavilion to the north side of the garden.\n\nThe memorial cross is a typical Baker design, with an octagonal cross section, standing on an octagonal base. Baker had proposed a similar design of memorial cross to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), but a different design by Sir Reginald Blomfield was selected instead: the Cross of Sacrifice familiar at many CWGC cemeteries. Baker used versions of his cross in many of the municipal war memorials that he was commissioned to design after the First World War. He was also responsible for the design of 113 cemeteries on the Western Front, including Tyne Cot, Delville Wood South African National Memorial and Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial.\n\nThe central wheel-headed Latin cross is decorated with roses and lilies representing England and France. It stands on an octagonal shaft and simple octagonal plinth, surrounded by a small octagonal pavement, in the centre of a grass lawn. A rectangular pavilion constructed of red brick stands to the north side of the garden, with three round-headed arches facing towards the cross in the south; the arches were later closed by metal railings. The hipped roof of the pavilion is covered with clay tiles, and the brick floor is laid in a herringbone pattern. The solid side and rear walls bear stone plaques with dedications and lists of names. Baker used similar brick shelters at other memorials, including some for the CWGC on the Western Front.\n\nThe Portland stone plaques commemorate the 139 servicemen from Hatfield killed during the First World War. The names of a further 58 men and women were added after the Second World War, along with 34 civilians killed in the 503 bombing raids that affected the area, many targeting the de Havilland aircraft factory nearby .\n\nThe memorial was built on land to the east of the Great North Road, near the gates leading to Hatfield House. The site was donated by James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury. Construction cost £1,500. The memorial was unveiled on 12 June 1921 by Thomas Brand, 3rd Viscount Hampden (the Lord Lieutenant of Hertfordshire, who had commanded a battalion of the Hertfordshire Regiment) and dedicated by the Bishop of Exeter Lord William Cecil (the younger brother of the 4th Marquess). The names of the dead were read out at the ceremony by Lord Salisbury.\n\nThe names of a further 58 men and women were added after the Second World War, along with the names of 34 civilians killed in the 503 bombing raids in the district.

{"topic": "Old Master Q", "document": "Old Master Q (; Wong's romanization: Lo Fu Gee) is a Hong Kong manhua created by Alfonso Wong. The cartoon first appeared in the newspapers and magazines in Hong Kong on 3 February 1962, and later serialised in 1964. The comic is still in publication today, and is the oldest Asian comic series in publication.\n\nThe comic is copyrighted by WangZ Inc, a company established by Joseph Wong Chak (Alfonso Wong's eldest son) in Taipei, Taiwan. Joseph Wong still continues to create new volumes.\n\nName\nAlfonso Wong explained that  (\"Lo\") means \"old\",  is \"a rather ordinary, but respectable title\" over two-thousand-year old which denotes a \"learned one\" \"who can become a teacher ('Fu Gee') or, or one who has studied a lot\"; the English title \"Old Master Q\" \"sort of\" translates the Chinese title, with Q being abbreviated from earlier \"Cute\". Wong additionally noted the similarity between his main character's English title \"Old Master Q\" & the name Ah Q of Lu Xun's character, whom Wong considered to be \"rather  and satirical\".\n\nCharacters\nThe series' cast is led by Old Master Q (), an elderly, lanky man dressed in a distinctive traditional Chinese attire. The character is created to satire Asian cultures in particularly backward conservatism, hubris, showing-off attitude, ungratefulness, rash, irresponsibility, weak-will, and even delusion. Most of the time, he is depicted as a person who keep living in the past in the ever-changing and brutally unfair world where money is the absolute power. To highlight this, Q is depicted in many short stories to mostly gets his rewards for being a good person in the form of being backstabbed; wrongfully accuse of wrongdoings as well as being hated for no apparent reasons. \n\nKelvin Chan of the South China Morning Post described Q as \"eccentric\".\n\nSupporting characters include: \nBig Potato () Old Master Q's identically-dressed friend with a stumpy, big-headed build. \nMr. Chin (, 'ordinary Joe' character, good friend with Old Master Q and Potato. \nMiss Chan (), Old Master Q's love interest. Vain and gold-digging, she always see herself as the most beautiful woman alive and has a tendency to ditch W every time she gets her hands on some rich individuals. \nMr. Chiu (), main antagonist to Old Master Q, often pranking each other). He often depicted as an arrogant rich individual who looks down on people as well as being incredibly petty.\n\nFormat and themes\nThe overall theme of the comics centres around humour, with characters usually portrayed in a variety of social statuses, professions and time periods, ranging from beggars and office workers to actors and ancient warriors, which allows for a wide variety of scenarios to explore. More outlandish situations incorporate surrealism, close encounters with aliens, ghost sightings, and the afterlife. While each comic is typically produced as short strips of four, six or twelve panels, longer comics have been produced revolving around lengthier adventures of the main cast pitted again gangsters in modern Hong Kong or warriors in a wuxia setting.\n\nWhile Old Master Q comics primarily focuses on humour, it also reflects changing social trends, particularly from the 1960s to the 1980s. The comics would sometimes feature societal problems in urban life, such as poverty, petty thefts and secret societies. It also poked fun at fashion, contemporary art and rock music. The comic strips sometimes also bemoan the decline of ethical or moral values in modern-day living. Characters often display acts of selfishness or misery, although the comics occasionally display good values like filial piety. The language barrier between the Chinese language and the English language is also depicted in some comic strips, illustrated with Old Master Q's difficulty communicating with foreigners, especially Westerners.\n\nThe comics have, on some occasions, expressed complexity in the plots and serious views on major political changes taking place in Hong Kong during the 1960s-1980s. It had previously criticised overly Westernised Chinese, who were often shown in the comic strips kowtowing to Western interests over the local Chinese interests. The run-up to the handover of Hong Kong to China following the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 also became a point of interest, as a few comic strips were published through the late 1980s and early 1990s expressing the characters' fears of handover, frequently represented in a numeral of the year it would take place: 1997. Some of these comic strips also depict direct assault of representations of the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party, occasionally in the form of caricatured depictions of Deng Xiaoping. The handover was later depicted in more a positive light in the years leading to the actual event, possibly representing a changing perspective from the author.\n\nFilms\nThe comic series was made into many Cantonese and Mandarin cartoon animations, one of which combined live actors and advanced CGI graphics.\n\nThe list of Old Master Q films is as follows, in chronological order:\n\n Other actors in OMQ movies include: Hong Wei (紅薇), Connie Chan, Nancy Sit, Chu Yau-ko (朱由高), Fen Ni (芬妮)\n Other lyricists/singers include: Wong Jim, Joseph Koo, Leslie Cheung\n\nSpin-off\nA spin-off series called Q Master Q (Q夫子) shows young versions of the characters with similar clothing as their adult counterparts. Each of their names also are related to their counterparts:\n\nPlagiarism dispute \n\nSome cartoonists and readers claim that the idea of Old Master Q was actually created by Peng Di (朋弟) in the late 1930s and not Alfonso Wong, as some of whom were mostly professional Mainland cartoonists alleged that Peng Di's ideas were stolen by Alfonso Wong. They claimed that the cartoons first appeared in the newspapers and magazines in Beijing (Peking) and Tianjin (Tientsin). The character created by Peng Di was claimed to slightly resemble Old Master Q which is currently being copyrighted by OMQ ZMedia Ltd. The character by Peng Di wore similar clothing and had a little similarity in personality to that of Old Master Q. However, the formats, themes, and contents of the stories were different as Old Master Q was not heavy with dialogue making it easy for foreigners around the world to immerse themselves in the story.\n\nA writer from Tianjin published a book in 2001 containing samples of work by Peng Di, which displayed the similarities between Peng Di and Alfonso Wong's works. The result of this dispute remains unclear as WangZ Inc. has denied all plagiarism accusations.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official English Old Master Q site\n Official Chinese Old Master Q site\n\nHong Kong comics titles\nManhua titles\nHong Kong comics\nChinese animation\n1962 comics debuts\nComics characters introduced in 1962\nHumor comics\nSatirical comics\nGag-a-day comics\nPantomime comics\nText comics\nFictional Hong Kong people\nComics set in China\nManhua adapted into films\nComics adapted into animated series\nManhua adapted into television series", "instruction": " What is the evidence supporting the claims that Peng Di preceded Alfonso Wong in creating the concept of Old Master Q?"}
{"topic": "Freshwater, Isle of Wight", "document": "Freshwater is a large village and civil parish at the western end of the Isle of Wight, England. The southern, coastal part of the village is Freshwater Bay, named for the adjacent small cove.\nFreshwater sits at the western end of the region known as the Back of the Wight or the West Wight, a popular tourist area. \n \nFreshwater is close to steep chalk cliffs. It was the birthplace of physicist Robert Hooke and was the home of Poet Laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson.\n\nLandmarks\n\nFreshwater is famous for its geology and coastal rock formations that have resulted from centuries worth of coastal erosion. The \"Arch Rock\" was a well-known local landmark that collapsed on 25 October 1992. The neighbouring \"Stag Rock\" is so named because supposedly a stag leapt to the rock from the cliff to escape during a hunt. Another huge slab fell off the cliff face in 1968, and is now known as the \"Mermaid Rock\". Immediately behind Mermaid Rock lies a small sea cave that cuts several metres into the new cliff.\n\nFreshwater's beach is very popular with tourists and locals. It is mostly pebbles, but it is also covered in chalk from the nearby cliffs, which is frequently gathered by tourists as souvenirs.\n\nFreshwater features an excellent example of a surviving Victorian Beach hotel, The Albion. The Albion was built around the time Freshwater became well-regarded as a coastal resort and is still popular today. Frequent repair-work and repainting are undertaken on the building's sea-front exterior walls, due to strong storms which often batter rocks, and other debris, against it.\n\nThe hills above Freshwater are named after Tennyson. On the nearby Tennyson Down is a Cornish granite cross erected in 1897 in tribute to Tennyson, \"by the people of Freshwater, and other friends in England and America.\" There is also a hill in the area called 'Hooke Hill', named for Robert Hooke.\n\nThe Anglican All Saints' Church, Freshwater is one of the oldest churches on the Isle of Wight, and it was  listed in the Domesday survey of 1086. Mark Whatson is the current pastor of All Saints, which is in the Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth. A primary school associated with the church is nearby. There is a marble memorial commemorating Tennyson in All Saints Church. Tennyson's wife Emily and other family members are buried in the church cemetery. The church is also the site of a memorial to Tennyson's son, Lionel Tennyson, who died of malaria in 1886.\n\nDimbola Lodge, the home of Julia Margaret Cameron and now a photographic museum, is in the village of Freshwater Bay, which is part of Freshwater. There is also a tearoom and bookstore.\n\nTennyson's son, Hallam, donated land for a new church in Freshwater Bay. Hallam's wife Audrey Tennyson suggested that the church be named for St. Agnes. St. Agnes' Church, Freshwater was consecrated on 12 August 1908. It is the only thatched church on the Isle of Wight.\n\nFreshwater was the site of the largest station on the Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway that operated from 20 July 1889 to 21 September 1953. A supermarket and garden centre now occupies the location of the former station.\n\nFreshwater is near the source of the Western Yar, a river whose estuary runs north to Yarmouth.  Freshwater Marshes are a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and a large part of the Marshes is also a Local Nature Reserve called Afton Marshes.\n\nAt the western end of Freshwater Bay on a bluff are the remains of Fort Redoubt, also known as Fort Freshwater or Freshwater Redoubt, a Palmerston Fort. Fort Redoubt was built in 1855–1856 to protect Freshwater Bay and was in use until the early 20th century; until the military sold it in 1928. Presently, part of it is a private residence, and other portions are being developed as holiday flats. A doorway carved into the cliff below the fort was the main access to the building from the beach, although most of the iron stairway that formerly gave access has broken up due to the repeated actions of rust and the tide.\n\nTwo unusual structures that have been described as ice houses, pottery kilns or crematoria are found on Moons Hill in Freshwater. Robert Walker was the first to excavate these features in the 1890s, and he thought they were evidence of a Phoenician settlement in Freshwater. Chemical analyses suggest that they were most likely lime kilns.\n\nNotable residents\n\nThe renowned scientist Robert Hooke (1635–1703) was born in Freshwater in 1635. His father John Hooke was the curate of All Saints Church in Freshwater. When Hooke's father died in 1648, Hooke left Freshwater for London to be apprenticed to portrait painter Peter Lely. After that, he went to Westminster School and then Oxford.\n\nPainter George Morland lived in Freshwater in a structure known as the \"Cabin\" around 1800.\n\nBritish Poet laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson lived at nearby Farringford House (on the road between Freshwater and Alum Bay). Tennyson lived at Farringford from 1853 until the end of his life in 1892. Tennyson wrote of Farringford:\n\nTennyson rented Farringford in 1853 and then bought it in 1856. He found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to \"Aldworth\", a stately home on a hill known as Blackdown between Lurgashall and Fernhurst, about  south of Haslemere in West Sussex in 1869. However, he returned to Farringford to spend the winters.\n\nPioneering photographer Julia Margaret Cameron lived in Freshwater at Dimbola Lodge from 1860 to 1875. Gertrude Fenton, the novelist and editor of The Carisbrooke Magazine, lived at Lacey's Farm, Freshwater in the early 1880's.\n\nIn 1960, Dekyi Tseri, mother of the current Dalai Lama, stayed at the guest house of Sir Basil Gould's widow Cecily in Freshwater for six weeks. Tseri, known to Tibetans as \"Amala\", meaning \"The Great Mother\", was recuperating after a throat operation to remove a benign polyp performed at St. Mary's Hospital in London.\n\nFreshwater was also the birthplace of Sir Vivian Ernest Fuchs (11 February 1908 – 11 November 1999). An English explorer, and Fellow of the Royal Society, whose expeditionary team completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica in 1958.\n\nOrganisations\n\nThe Freshwater Village Association was created in November 2006. The Freshwater Village Association was formed by Freshwater residents who are concerned that Freshwater might lose its identity as a village.  The Freshwater Bay Residents Association was created on 2 July 1984, to express concern over the development of Freshwater Bay.\n\nFreshwater Lifeboat is an independent lifesaving organisation based in Freshwater Bay. It operates the Freshwater Bay Lifeboat Station on the promenade along Freshwater Bay and two lifeboats from public donations and profits from shop sales since it is not part of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.\n\nIt hosts the Freshwater and Totland Carnival every year.\n\nFreshwater is the headquarters of the Robert Hooke Society, who have created a walking trail around the area called the \"Hooke Trail\" to visit sites associated with him. They hold bi-monthly meetings at the Island Planetarium at Fort Victoria, a yearly Memorial Luncheon on 3 March on the date of his death and week-long celebrations of his birthday, 18 July.\n\nHistory\n\nThere is evidence of a Roman harbour at the end of the Western Yar.

Degesch held the patent on the infamous pesticide Zyklon, a variant of which was used to execute people in the gas chambers of German extermination camps during the Holocaust. Through the firms Tesch & Stabenow GmbH (Testa) and Heerdt-Linger (Heli), Degesch sold the poisonous gas Zyklon B to the German Army and the Schutzstaffel (SS).\n\nDegesch was founded in 1919 as a subsidiary of Degussa. Its first director was chemistry Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. In 1936, Degussa and IG Farben each held 42.5% of the shares, while Th. Goldschmidt AG held the remaining 15%. During the years 1938 through 1943, Degesch was extremely profitable. For most of these years, IG Farben received dividends amounting to twice the value of their shares. After the Second World War Degesch continued production. In 1986, the company was sold to Detia Freyberg GmbH; the current name is Detia-Degesch GmbH.\n\nProsecution \nDuring the IG Farben trial the director of Degesch, Gerhard Friedrich Peters, implicated himself. He received information by Kurt Gerstein about the murder of people using Zyklon and was informed that the German army needed the gas without the usual additives that were added to warn people by smell of its poisonous nature (the Zyklon B variant).\nIn 1949, Peters was charged with murder in the court of Frankfurt and convicted and sentenced to five years imprisonment. The conviction was in 1952, legally confirmed in an appeal and set to six years. Peters went to prison but was acquitted in a new appeal in 1953. The law had changed; he was no longer considered guilty in assisting in murder. The chairman of the board of directors from 1939 to 1945, Hermann Schlosser, was arrested in February 1948, and acquitted in April 1948; later he took another job as chairman of the board.\n\nThe owner of Tesch & Stabenow, Bruno Tesch, and its director Karl Weinbacher were convicted and sentenced to death by a British tribunal and executed in Hamelin Prison on 16 May 1946.

The exact date of construction is unsettled, but the consensus supports 1874.

There had previously been a hotel in the vicinity which burned prior to 1859.\n\nAbout ten years later the hotel was leased by Thomas C. Luther, who purchased it in 1888 and whose family operated it until his death in 1937.  In its heyday  the hotel hosted \"many famous celebrities of the early twentieth century—Lillian Russell, “Diamond Jim” Brady, Jack Dempsey, and wealthy financier Jay Gould among them.\" The facilities boasted a boxing ring used for training by Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney, and Angel Firpo.  The hotel was renowned for its \"fish and game suppers.\"\n\nLuther operated excursion boats on Saratoga Lake between the hotel and the \"Trolley Park\", later Kaydeross Park, and Moon's Lake House at the west (that is, north) end of the lake.

{"topic": "Shoghakat, Armenia", "document": "Shoghakat () is a village in the Shoghakat Municipality of the Gegharkunik Province of Armenia, located near Lake Sevan, northwest of the Artanish Peninsula. The village was founded in the 1810s by Mordvins exiled from Russia. At the beginning of the 20th century Turks settled in the village. In 1988-1989 Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan settled in the village.\n\nToponymy \nThe village was formerly known as Nadezhdino, Shordzhalu and later Shorzha () until November 2017.\n\nHistorical sites \n\nA 17th-century chapel and cemetery are located along the southern outskirts of the village.  On the hill overlooking Shoghakat, there are the ruins of another chapel. Remains of an Iron Age fort can be seen in same area.\n\nNature \n\nThe Artanish peninsula of Lake Sevan with a hill of the same name, is located close to the village. Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae) with wild-growing edible sour berries grow at the shores of Lake Sevan. Planted after the lowering of the level of Lake Sevan in the Soviet period. The vicinity of the village hosts 111 species of butterflies and is recognized as the Prime Butterfly Area \"Artanish-Shoghakat\". Also the area is known as one of the key birding sites of Armenia.\n\nInfrastructure \nThe village can be accessed via Armenian road M14 (repaired in 2020-21) running along the north-east shore of Lake Sevan either from Tsovagyugh village (in the northwest of Shoghakat) or from Vardenis (in the south-east).  Another road connects it to the town of Chambarak in the north-west. In summer, passenger trains of South Caucasus Railways commute from Yerevan, via the towns of Hrazdan and Sevan.\n\nRecreation \n\nThe shores of Lake Sevan near the village hosts several popular camping sites. Most popular is perhaps the camping site called \"Whishup\" (a wordplay with Vishap, \"dragon\" in Armenian) located between the road and lakeshore at about 1.5 km from the village towards Tsovagyugh. Various water sports, like wakeboarding, kiteboarding, are practiced there and some equipment is available for rent along a sandy beach with a cafe. In summer evenings concerts are held at the stage on the beach. On the opposite side of the Artanish peninsula, the yachting clubs \"Ayas\" and \"Armenian camp\" can be found. Sailing and paddling equipment can be rented there and guided tours on a sailing ship can be booked.\n\nA copy of a medieval Armenian sea vessel is placed there. Built in the 90's and named Cilicia (referring to Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, where such vessels were built and used) it sailed round Europe, and was brought back to Lake Sevan. There is also a diver's club located nearby.\n\nMunicipal administration \nAfter administrative reforms in November 2017, the name of the village was changed from Shorzha to Shoghakat and it was assigned as the administrative centre of the same-name rural municipality including the villages of Aghberk, Artanish, Drakhtik, Jil and Tsapatagh.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n\nPopulated places in Gegharkunik Province\nErivan Governorate", "instruction": " What is the significance of the name change from Shorzha to Shoghakat for the village and its municipal administration?"}

{"topic": "Stylidium debile", "document": "Stylidium debile, commonly known as the frail triggerplant, is a carnivorous, dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the genus Stylidium (family Stylidiaceae). S. debile is endemic to coastal areas in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia.\n\nCharacteristics \n\nStylidium debile is an herbaceous annual plant that grows from 15 to 30 cm tall. Oblanceolate or obovate leaves, about 20-200 per plant, form a basal rosette with stems absent or present. The leaves are generally 8–30 mm long and 3–7 mm wide. This species produces 1-2 scapes per plant that are glabrous. Inflorescences are 10–25 cm long and produce pink flowers that bloom year-round in their native range. S. debile'''s historical distribution included a range on the Atherton Tableland, at Mt Playfair near Tambo, Queensland, and as far south as Alexandria Swamps in Sydney, though it is probably extinct in these locations due to extensive habitat modification. More recent herbarium collections relate a distribution from Blackdown Tableland and Deepwater National Park in Queensland south to the area around Coffs Harbour in New South Wales. Its typical habitat has been reported as sandy or pale silty clay soils on creekbanks or in swampy areas. Dominant vegetation in association with its habitat include Melaleuca quinquenervia and Lophostemon suaveolens. S. debile is most closely related to S. paniculatum but differs by the inflorescence form and the presence of bracts. Its conservation status has been assessed as secure.\n\n Taxonomy \n\nThe infraspecific taxonomy of this species formerly listed two varieties:\n Stylidium debile var. debile Maiden & Betche\n Stylidium debile var. paniculatum Maiden & Betche\nJoseph Maiden and Ernst Betche described the differences between the two varieties in a 1905 publication. In 1999, Anthony Bean elevated S. debile var. paniculatum to the species level, giving it the name Stylidium paniculatum (Maiden & Betche) A.R.Bean, thus rendering the autonym var. debile redundant.\n\n Cultivation \nThis coastal species is one of the relative few Stylidium species that is available in cultivation and is grown in similar conditions to tropical Australian Drosera''. It is propagated by division of the vegetative clones that arise from the root system. And though in its native range it may be considered an annual, in cultivation it is mostly a perennial.\n\nSee also \n\n List of Stylidium species\n\nReferences \n\nAsterales of Australia\nCarnivorous plants of Australia\nFlora of Queensland\nFlora of New South Wales\nPlants described in 1858\ndebile\nTaxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller", "instruction": " What specific environmental factors influence the growth and development of Stylidium debile in its natural habitat?"}

{"topic": "JEDI", "document": "JEDI (Jupiter Energetic-particle Detector Instrument) is an instrument on the Juno spacecraft orbiting planet Jupiter. JEDI coordinates with the several other space physics instruments on the Juno spacecraft to characterize and understand the space environment of Jupiter's polar regions, and specifically to understand the generation of Jupiter's powerful aurora. It is part of a suite of instruments to study the magnetosphere of Jupiter. JEDI consists of three identical detectors that use microchannel plates and foil layers to detect the energy, angle, and types of ion within a certain range. It can detect electrons between 40 and 500 keV (Kilo electron-volts), and hydrogen and oxygen from a few tens of keV to less than 1000 keV (1 MeV). JEDI uses radiation hardened Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)s. JEDI was turned on in January 2016 while still en route to Jupiter to also study interplanetary space. JEDI uses solid state detectors (SSD's) to measure the total energy (E) of both the ions and the electrons. The MCP anodes and the SSD arrays are configured to determine the directions of arrivals of the incoming charged particles. The instruments also use fast triple coincidence and optimum shielding to suppress penetrating background radiation and incoming UV foreground.\n\nJEDI is designed to collect data on \"energy, spectra, mass species (H, He, O, S), and angular distributions\"; the plan is to study the energies and distribution of charged particles. It can detect them at between 30 keV and 1 GeV, whereas JADE, another instrument on the spacecraft, is designed to observe below 30 keV.  One of the concepts being studied is that energy from Jupiter's rotation is being converted into its atmosphere and magnetosphere.\n\nIt is radiation hardened to collect in situ data on the planet's auroral magnetic field lines, the equatorial magnetosphere, and the polar ionosphere It was built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). One of the goals is to understand the aurora, and how particles are accelerated to such high speeds. One of the mysteries of Jupiter is that X-rays are emitted from the poles, but do not seem to come from the auroral ring.\n\nEach detector has a field of view of 120 degree by 12 degrees, and they are positioned to provide a 360 degree (a full circle) view of the sky along that axis. The Juno spacecraft travels very rapidly in the close vicinity of Jupiter (up to 50 km/s) and also spins very slowly (2 RPM).\n\nJEDI can detected particles from 30 to 1000 keV including:\nElectrons\nProton (hydrogen) ions\nHelium ions\nSulfur ions\nOxygen ions\nEnergetic neutral atoms (ENA's)\n\nIn relation to other space missions, an instrument on the Earth-orbiting Van Allen Probes (launched 2012), called RBSPICE, is nearly identical to JEDI.

{"topic": "Siege of Pensacola (1707)", "document": "The siege of Pensacola included two separate attempts in 1707 by English-supported Creek Indians to capture the town and fortress of Pensacola, one of two major settlements (the other was St. Augustine) in Spanish Florida.\n\nThe attacks, part of Queen Anne's War (the North American theater of the War of the Spanish Succession), resulted in the burning of the town, and caused most of its Indian population to flee, although the fort withstood repeated attacks.  The battles were primarily fought in the nighttime hours due to the excessive heat of the day. \n\nThe first siege, in August, resulted in the destruction of the town, but Fort San Carlos de Austria successfully resisted the onslaught. In late November, a second expedition arrived, and made unsuccessful attacks on three consecutive nights before withdrawing. Pensacola's governor, Don Sebastián de Moscoso, whose garrison was depleted by disease, recruited convicted criminals to assist in the fort's defense.\n\nBackground \n\nEnglish and Spanish colonies in southeastern North America began coming into conflict as early as the middle of the 17th century. The Spanish population of Florida at the time was fairly small. Since its founding in the 16th century, the Spanish had set up a network of missions whose primary purpose was to pacify the local Indian population and convert them to Roman Catholicism. The founding by English colonists of 1670 of Charles Town (present-day Charleston, South Carolina) in the recently established (1663) Province of Carolina heightened tensions. By the early 18th century, Carolina traders like Anthony Dodsworth and Thomas Nairne had established alliances with Creek Indians in the upper watersheds of rivers draining into the Gulf of Mexico, who they supplied with arms and from whom they purchased slaves and animal pelts. These traders penetrated into Spanish Florida, leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides.\n\nIn 1700, Carolina's governor, Joseph Blake, threatened the Spanish that English claims to Pensacola, established by the Spanish in 1698, would be enforced. Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, the French founder of Mobile, in January 1702, warned the Spanish commander at Pensacola that he should properly arm the Apalachee Indians and engage in a vigorous defense against potential English incursions into Spanish territory. D'Iberville even offered equipment and supplies for that purpose. However, an attempt at a punitive expedition against the Creek resulted in a rout of the Spanish and their Apalachee allies in October, shortly before news of war declarations bringing the English government into the War of the Spanish Succession arrived. After a failed Carolinian assault on St. Augustine, Spanish mission towns were severely reduced by numerous raids by combined Creek-Carolina raids against the Spanish mission network from 1703 to 1706. A French-organized 1706 expedition against Charles Town was a failure but motivated Carolina authorities to again target the Spanish at Pensacola and the French at Mobile. Nairne proposed a major expedition after the attack on Charles Town, intending to recruit as many as 1,500 Indians to capture Mobile, but political divisions in Carolina prevented execution of the plan.\n\nFirst siege \nIn 1707, Pensacola was under the command of Don Sebastián de Moscoso. The exact size of his garrison in 1707 is not known. The authorized strength of the garrison was 220, but it rarely reached that strength owing to the difficulty in recruiting soldiers, for what was viewed as a highly undesirable posting, and a fairly high rate of desertion. Moscoso reported in 1708 that the garrison numbered about 100, having been reduced by the events of 1707. The garrison was housed in Fort San Carlos de Austria, a wooden stockade fort built in 1698.\n\nExtant records do not describe the composition of the forces that attacked Pensacola in August beyond \"several hundred Tallapoosas and a few South Carolina traders\". The siege began on 12 August with the arrival of a band of 20 to 30 Indians, who began terrorizing the Indians living in the town outside the fort. They took prisoners (including some women and children) and began burning houses. Governor Moscoso fired one of the fort's cannons, scattering the attackers; some of their captives managed to escape to the fort in the confusion. Two days later, ten men sent out of the fort to do laundry disappeared. On 14 August an estimated 300 Indians appeared before the fort and engaged it in a battle lasting several hours. The next day the attack resumed, as did the pillaging of the town. Activity quieted down until 18 August, when an English flag was raised over a house near the fort. This prompted Moscoso to open fire from the fort, beginning a battle that raged until dark. That day, the attackers burned down the rest of the town, and Moscoso's men had to work to prevent the fort from burning as well.\n\nWhile the Spanish inspected the rubble, one of them was taken prisoner on 19 August and a second person was captured the next day. This marked the end of active assaults on the fort. However, the area beyond the range of the fort's guns was unsafe for at least the next month; a number of people also disappeared after they ventured too far from its vicinity.\n\nSecond siege \nThe second siege began with the arrival on 27 November of a contingent of about 20 Carolina traders and 300 Creeks, primarily Tallapoosas and Alabamas.\nOn that day, a Carolinian (unidentified in Spanish reports, but possibly Thomas Nairne) brought a demand for surrender written in English. Since none of the Spaniards could read it, he was sent away, and the demand was eventually transmitted orally by a French Huguenot. Moscoso rejected the demand, even though his garrison was depleted by disease. The besiegers began an ineffectual attack on the fort around midnight which lasted until daybreak, at which point they delivered a final surrender demand which Moscoso again refused. In order to supplement his forces, he successfully recruited convicts being held in the fort's guardhouse to participate in the defense, offering them freedom and money for their service. During each of the next two nights the besiegers renewed their attacks on the fort, without significant effect. During the night of 29/30 November, one of the leading Creek chiefs was killed. This apparently broke the besiegers' morale, for the siege was lifted the following morning. The attackers were reported to have suffered significant casualties.\n\nWord of the attacking force had reached the French at Mobile on 24 November. Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville raised a force of 100 Frenchmen and 400 Indians. They reached Pensacola on 8 December, only to learn that the siege had been lifted a week earlier.\n\nAftermath \n\nThese attacks were the last major assaults on Pensacola in the war, although there continued to be minor skirmishes and kidnappings. Most of the Indians that fled during the sieges never returned, reducing Pensacola to little more than its garrison. Governor Bienville learned from a Spaniard who had escaped English captivity that Mobile was also being targeted for attack.

The group formed after guitarist Adam Spark asked Kenny to sing on a handful of commercial demos. The results were so good, they decided to form a band and release the songs themselves. They took their name from an article one member had read about the absence of birds in Tokyo's high-density central business district due to pollution and overcrowding. \"We thought that was interesting, no birds in Tokyo – we thought, we'll be the birds of Tokyo\", he says.\n\nIn January 2005, Birds of Tokyo released their debut EP, Birds of Tokyo. In October 2005, Birds of Tokyo released a double A side single \"One Way/Stay\".

{"topic": "Dave Sands", "document": "Dave Sands (born David Ritchie; 4 February 1926 – 11 August 1952) was an Indigenous Australian boxer.\n\nThe man the Americans called the \"boxer with the educated left hand\" received his due when he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998 at a ceremony held in Los Angeles, recognised as one of the greatest boxers never to have won a world title.\n\nDave was the 2009 Inductee for the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame Veterans category.\n\nEarly life\nBorn at Burnt Bridge Mission Kempsey, New South Wales, fifth of eight children of George Ritchie, a rodeo-rider and timber-cutter of mixed Aboriginal and European descent, and his Aboriginal wife Mabel, née Russell.\n\nSands' brothers Clement, Percival, George, Alfred and Russell also boxed, emulating their father and their maternal great-uncle Bailey Russell, a noted bare-knuckle fighter. In 1939 Percy travelled to Newcastle to train with Tom Maguire, At the age of 15 Sands joined Percy training with Maguire and both lived at Maguire's gym. Dave and his five brothers took on the Sands name, taken off a train guard \"Snowy\" Sands who helped Percy Ritchie, travel to fight fare free in 1940.\n\nCareer\nWithout Maguire's knowledge, Dave fought a four-round preliminary bout in August 1941 at Newcastle Stadium, swinging his way to victory in the first round. Maguire disapproved, but quickly transformed him into a skilled boxer. By the end of 1942 he had knocked out a dozen opponents at Newcastle. On 11 August 1945 he married 18-year-old Bessie Emma Burns at St Paul's Church of England, Stockton, New South Wales.\n\nSands was soon boxing in twelve-round matches before excited crowds of up to ten thousand people in Brisbane and Sydney. In May 1946 he defeated Jack Kirkham for the Australian middleweight title. Three months later he knocked out Jack Johnson in four rounds to become national light-heavyweight champion. The rematches were even more one-sided: Kirkham was defeated in five rounds and Johnson fell after 2½ minutes of furious punching. By 1948 Sands had beaten all his local opponents and most American 'imports'. His mauling of a French fighter Tony Toniolo in less than two minutes in February 1949 led the English promoter Jack Solomons to take an interest in him.\n\nDespite an enthusiastic reception from the British press, Sands began his campaign for a world title disastrously. In London on 4 April 1949, while suffering from a swollen, recently vaccinated arm, he was outpointed by Tommy Yarosz. Fifteen days later Sands won, dismally, against a spoiler, Lucien Caboche. Maguire then moved him to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where friendly locals and a promoter Joe Shepherd restored his confidence. After two solid victories, he returned to London and in July thrashed the much fancied Robert Villemain in the 'fight of the year'. On 6 September Sands demolished Dick Turpin in 2 minutes 35 seconds for the British Empire middleweight title.\n\nShortly after his triumphal return to Australia in November 1949, Sands survived a serious accident when the steering on his motorcar failed and the vehicle somersaulted into a creek. Over the next eighteen months he contested and won nine fights, one of them a fifteen-rounder in September 1950 in which he took the Australian heavyweight championship from Alf Gallagher. Sands had become a leading contender for the world middleweight title and Maguire vainly sought to arrange a bout with the American champion Sugar Ray Robinson. In the tricky maze of international boxing promotion, his efforts were marked by a paper chase of offers and counter-offers. Sands defeated Mel Brown in London in July 1951 in a preliminary to a title fight between Robinson and another contender Randolph Turpin. Had Maguire's negotiations succeeded, Sands would have been in Turpin's place and probably would have beaten an unfit Robinson, as did Turpin.\n\nIn October 1951, Sands won two fights in the United States. Back home, he hoped for a world title-bout, but he was estranged from Maguire. A new manager Bede Kerr reopened discussions with Robinson's connections, but the chance never came.\n\nDeath\nOn 11 August 1952, the truck Sands was driving with 15 passengers overturned at roadworks near Dungog, New South Wales. Sands died of head and internal injuries that evening in the local hospital and was buried at Sandgate Cemetery, near Newcastle, New South Wales. His wife, and their son and two daughters survived him; their third daughter was born in November. Sands had earned about £30,000, but it went on manager's fees, travel costs, tax, family expenses and generosity to his kin. A public appeal raised more than £2500, sufficient to pay off his Stockton home and create a trust fund for his family.\n\nProfessional boxing record\n\nTitles\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nPictures held and digitised as part of the Arnold Thomas boxing collection by the National Library of Australia  \n Dave Sands, Empire and Australian Middleweight Champion and Tom Maguire, trainer\n British Empire title bout, Dave Sands, 11 st. 5 lb., K.O.

Graham comes home one evening to find his wife, Cora (Ainley), acting as if he is an insane stranger.\n\nA man who looks exactly like him, Albert \"Bert\" Rand (Nelson), has taken his place and is playing cards and drinking in his living room.

On July 10, 2018, independent label Needlejuice Records announced vinyl, CD and cassette releases, which shipped on October 21, 2018.\n\nAll tracks were written, performed and recorded by Neil Cicierega. The album's cover art was created by Cicierega's wife, comic book artist Ming Doyle. The song \"Sweet Bod\" features a guitar solo by Dave Kitsberg of Time Lord rock group Time Crash. The album received generally positive reception and was largely successful, with the track \"Touch-Tone Telephone\" being the second most played track on Spotify, with over 64 million streams, and surpassing \"The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny\".\n\nHistory \nShortly after the release of Lemon Demon's 2008 album View-Monster, Cicierega began work on the next Lemon Demon album which would be released eight years later as Spirit Phone. \n\nIn July 2009, \"Eighth Wonder\", a song about the cryptid Gef, was made available as an mp3 download on lemondemon.com, followed by a music video for the song posted to his Youtube channel in November of that year. This release was nearly identical to the version heard on Spirit Phone. A demo produced during this time titled \"Ivanushka\" would later be adapted into Spirit Phone track \"Touch-Tone Telephone\". The original version was eventually released to Neil Cicierega's Patreon in January 2018.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2016, Cicierega would tease more early versions of tracks that would eventually appear on Spirit Phone, released online as demos or performed live. In April 2012, an early version of \"Reaganomics\" was uploaded to Neil's second channel, along with a video accompaniment intended for live shows, edited from clips of Ronald Reagan in his final film role The Killers. \"Reaganomics\" would be performed live at the anime convention Youmacon 2012, along with early versions of \"As Your Father I Expressly Forbid It\", \"Ancient Aliens\", and \"Cabinet Man\".\n\nIn July 2012, Cicierega posted two unused opening themes for the animated television series Gravity Falls to his Tumblr blog, elements of which would become Spirit Phone bonus tracks \"Gravitron\", and \"Moon's Request\" respectively (the latter being a remix of the original opening theme Cicierega made for Gravity Falls that removes any mentions of the show). In October 2014, \"When He Died\" was released on Patreon.\n\nThe album was released digitally on February 29, 2016, followed by a remastered physical release on vinyl, CD, and cassette in October 2018 by Needlejuice Records, followed by 8-track and minidisc releases in 2019 and 2020.\n\nReception \nMashable included \"Touch-Tone Telephone\" and \"Eighth Wonder\" on their official 2019 Halloween playlist, calling \"Touch-Tone Telephone\" one of many \"real gems\".

The album was the best-selling album on Bandcamp for the first week of its release.\n\n\"Cabinet Man\", a song about a man who turns himself into a half-human arcade machine, would later inspire the indie game Neon Nemesis, featured at the 2019 Alt.Ctrl.GDC Exhibition.

In 1992, ABS-CBN hired Fermin to host the Sunday talk show Showbiz Lingo with Butch Francisco. Fermin's participation as main host of Showbiz Lingo had the blessings from her producers Inday Badiday, and did not run in conflict with Movie Magazine, which aired on Saturdays. But in 1994, Fermin eventually left Movie Magazine and GMA Network after she signed an exclusive talent contract with ABS-CBN, which in return capitalized on Fermin's new title as the '90s \"Queen of Intrigues\" by giving her the daily talk show Cristy Per Minute which started airing in 1995.

{"topic": "Jigme Singye Wangchuck", "document": "Jigme Singye Wangchuck (, ; born 11 November 1955) is a member of the House of Wangchuck who was the king of Bhutan (Druk Gyalpo) from 1972 until his abdication in 2006.\n\nDuring his reign, he advocated the use of a Gross National Happiness index to measure the well-being of citizens rather than Gross domestic product.\n\nEarly life\nJigme Singye Wangchuck was born in Dechencholing Palace in Thimphu, Bhutan, on 11 November 1955. to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Ashi Kesang Choden Wangchuck. The political officer of India stationed in Sikkim and the representative of the Sikkimese government came soon after to offer felicitations to the royal parents and to pay their respect to the newborn prince. At the age of four, sometime in 1959, the young Crown Prince received the offerings of good wishes and respects by the public, monks, and officials for the first time in Tashichho Dzong.\n\nWangchuck received western and traditional learning in various institutions. He began studying at Dechencholing Palace, when he was six years old, in 1961. Soon afterwards, he went to study at St. Joseph's School, Darjeeling, in India. In 1964, he attended Heatherdown School in England where he completed his studies in 1969. The next phase of his formal education took place at Namselling Palace in 1969. Finally, he attended Ugyen Wangchuck Academy at Satsham Choten in Paro, which was established in 1970, along with a class of selected students from all over Bhutan.\n\nCrown Prince\nIn 1971 Wangchuck's father appointed Wangchuck as the Chairman of National Planning Commission, charged with the planning and co-ordination of the five year development plan. The following year, on 16 June 1972, he was made the Trongsa Penlop bestowing on him directly the saffron scarf or namza. The 3rd Five-Year Plan (FYP), which spanned the period 1971–77, was in progress when his father died. Wangchuck was 16 at that time. 1972 to 1976 was the period of the 3rd FYP, and 1976 to 1981 was the period of 4th FYP. As both King and the Chairman of the National Planning Commission, the clearing house for the programmes and projects, Wangchuck guided the planned activities first in broad terms and then increasingly in detail.\n\nRoyal wedding\nIn a public ceremony, the Royal Wedding of Wangchuck was held in Dechog Lhakhang in Punakha Dzong on 31 October 1988, corresponding with the Descending Day of Buddha. The four queens, Dorji Wangmo Wangchuck, Tshering Pem Wangchuck, Tshering Yangdon Wangchuck and Sangay Choden Wangchuck are daughters of Dasho Yab Ugyen Dorji, the descendant of both the mind and speech incarnations of Ngawang Namgyal, and Yum Thuiji Zam.\n\nPreviously, they had married privately in 1979.\n\nRural development\nIn his Coronation Address on 2 June 1974, Jigme Singye stressed the need \"to attain self-reliance and preserve Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence.\" He also stressed that any development undertaking should be a genuine collaboration between the people and the government. During the 1970s, immediate aims for rural households unfolded in terms of intensive valley projects, cash crops cultivation, especially potatoes – irrigation, and resettlement. Enhancing the income and livelihood of the rural people were the main focus of the 3rd and 4th FYPs. Soon after he acceded to the throne, Jigme Singye launched the Trashigang and Tsirang Intensive Valley Development Projects in 1972. These projects were part of a larger vision of food self-sufficiency and income generation.\n\nEncouraged by the achievements in the Trashigang and Tsirang Intensive Valley Projects, similar valley projects were replicated in Mongar and the newly created Shumar (Pemagatshel) districts. These projects were also sites of experimental and participatory decision making. It led to the formation of Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogchungs (DYTs), which brought the , gups and officials to prepare plans together. By 1981, Trashigang and Tsirang had fully functional DYTs.\n\nIn higher altitude areas a new initiative by Wangchuck in early 1970s consisted of diffusing potatoes as cash crops, first tested in royal pastureland of Longtoed and Longmed, which had been converted to potato farms. Beginning with the large-scale production in Khaling and Chapcha, potatoes become a key export crop, reaching 60,000 tonnes, grown by over 10,725 households by 2006.\n\nIn southern Bhutan, the focus was on growing citrus fruits. For example, in 1977, the King encouraged the people of Dagana to start cardamom and orange plantations. Both of these cash crops are now major sources of rural income as 3,400 tonnes of cardamom, 55,558 tonnes of oranges and 7,400 tonnes of apples were produced in 2006 due to the initiatives taken first in 1970s.\n\nSocio-economic development\n\nA Kasho (royal decree) issued by King Jigme Singye in 1986 directed the Planning Commission to ensure that \"the basis for the evaluation of the achievements of the Sixth Plan is to see whether the people enjoy happiness and comfort\". The social and economic indicators point towards sub-ordinate goals, not ultimate goals which was to be measured from a holistic, GNH point of view. Happiness and contentment became the ultimate yardstick of progress.\n\nData, which enables comparison of achievements over time starting from 1985 onwards, some 14 years after the king's ascension to the throne.\n\nThere is a lack of systematic quantitative information about the social and economic situation of Bhutan for the 1970s. The baselines for historical comparison available today were first collected in 1985 – the year when time series data was collected. Some information that date back to 1974 indicate the low base of infrastructure that existed at that time. There were 11 ill-equipped hospitals, staffed mostly by foreign doctors, and 45 basic health units in 1974, the year Jigme Singye's coronation was held.\n\nSparse networks of 1,332 km of roads had been built by 1974, compared to 4,544 by the end of his reign in 2006. In 1974, 24 wireless stations linked the rest of the country. Telephone connections, mostly for officials in Thimphu, were limited to 480 in 1974 compared to 31,526 in 2006.\n\nThere were 13,410 students enrolled in schools compared to 151,260 or so in 2006. By 2006, school enrollment touched 90%, literacy 60%, and both were so mainly due to a free education policy (more information at Education in Bhutan and Ministry of Education Website).\n\nHealth services, safe drinking water and better nutrition have led to a 66-year life-span and lower morbidity during this life span. One of the constraints in education and health was the lack of qualified people. In 1976, King Jigme Singye commanded the establishment of the Royal Institute of Health Sciences (RIHS) and the first batch of Health Assistants and Basic Health Workers passed out in 1986. There were 56 health establishments in 1974; by 2006 there were 715 resulting in 90% free primary health coverage. In 1985, there was nearly 50% health coverage. Infant mortality has fallen from 142 in 1985, to 60 in 2006. This was mainly due to the success of universal child immunisation and the supply", "instruction": " What were the specific reasons that led Jigme Singye Wangchuck to establish the Royal Institute of Health Sciences in Bhutan in 1976?"}

{"topic": "Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)", "document": "The Polish–Muscovite War of 1605–1618, also known as the Polish–Muscovite War  or the Dimitriads, was a conflict fought between the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth together with Zaporozhian Cossacks from 1605 to 1618.\n\nRussia had been experiencing the Time of Troubles since the death of Tsar Feodor I in 1598, causing political instability and a violent succession crisis upon the extinction of the Rurik dynasty, and was ravaged by the major Famine from 1601 to 1603. Poland exploited Russia's civil wars when powerful members of the Polish szlachta began influencing Russian boyars and supporting False Dmitris for the title of Tsar of Russia against the crowned Boris Godunov and Vasili IV Shuysky. In 1605, Polish nobles conducted a series of skirmishes until the death of False Dmitry I in 1606, and invaded again in 1607 until Russia formed a military alliance with Sweden two years later. Polish King Sigismund declared war on Russia in response in 1609, aiming to gain territorial concessions and weaken Sweden's ally, winning many early victories such as the Battle of Klushino. In 1610, Polish forces entered Moscow and Sweden withdrew from the military alliance with Russia, instead triggering the Ingrian War.\n\nSigismund's son, the Prince Władysław of Poland, was elected tsar by the Seven Boyars in September 1610, but Sigismund refused to allow his son to become the new tsar unless the Muscovites agreed to convert to Catholicism, with the pro-Polish boyars ending their support for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1611, Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky formed a new army to launch a popular revolt against the Polish occupation. The Poles captured Smolensk in June 1611 but began to retreat after they were ousted from Moscow in September 1612. Michael Romanov, the son of Patriarch Filaret of Moscow, was elected Tsar of Russia in 1613, beginning the Romanov dynasty and ending the Time of Troubles. With little military action between 1612 and 1617, the war finally ended in 1618 with the Truce of Deulino, which granted the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth certain territorial concessions but preserved Russia's independence.\n\nThe war was the first major sign of the rivalry and uneasy relations between Poland and Russia which last to this day. Its aftermath had a long-lasting impact on Russian society, creating the negative stereotype of Poland in Russia and, most notably, giving rise to the Romanov dynasty which ruled Russia for three centuries until the February Revolution in 1917. It also left a noticeable mark on Russian culture, with renowned writers and composers portraying the war in works such as Boris Godunov (play) by Alexander Pushkin (adapted into an opera by Modest Mussorgsky), A Life for the Tsar by Mikhail Glinka, Pan Voyevoda by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov as well as films Minin and Pozharsky and 1612.\n\nNames of the war\nThe conflict is often referred to by different names, most commonly the Russo–Polish War, with the term Russia replacing the term Muscovy. In Polish historiography, the wars are usually referred to as the Dimitriads: the First Dymitriad (1605–1606) and Second Dymitriad (1607–1609) and the Polish–Muscovite War (1609–1618), which can subsequently be divided into two wars of 1609–1611 and 1617–1618, and may or may not include the 1617–1618 campaign, which is sometimes referred to as Chodkiewicz [Muscovite] Campaign. According to Russian historiography, the chaotic events of the war fall into the \"Time of Troubles\". The conflict with Poles is commonly called the Polish Invasion, Polish Intervention, or more specifically the Polish Intervention of the Early Seventeenth Century.\n\nPrelude to the war\n\nIn the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Russia was in a state of political and economic crisis. After the death of Tsar Ivan IV (\"the Terrible\") in 1584, and the death of his son Dimitri in 1591, several factions competed for the tsar's throne. In 1598, Boris Godunov was crowned to the Russian throne, marking the end of the centuries long rule of the Rurik dynasty. While his policies were rather moderate and well-intentioned, his rule was marred by the general perception of its questionable legitimacy and allegations of his involvement in orchestrating the assassination of Dimitri. While Godunov managed to put the opposition to his rule under control, he did not manage to crush it completely. To add to his troubles, the first years of the 17th century were exceptionally cold. The drop in temperature was felt all over the world and was most likely caused by a severe eruption of a volcano in South America. In Russia, it resulted in a great famine that swept through the country from 1601 to 1603.\n\nIn late 1600, a Polish diplomatic mission led by Chancellor Lew Sapieha with Eliasz Pielgrzymowski and Stanisław Warszycki arrived in Moscow and proposed an alliance between the Commonwealth and Russia, which would include a future personal union. They proposed that after one monarch's death without heirs, the other would become the ruler of both countries. However, Tsar Godunov declined the union proposal and settled on extending the Treaty of Jam Zapolski, which ended the Lithuanian wars of the 16th century, by 22 years (to 1622).\n\nSigismund and the Commonwealth magnates knew full well that they were not capable of any serious invasion of Russia; the Commonwealth army was too small, its treasury always empty, and the war lacked popular support. However, as the situation in Russia deteriorated, Sigismund and many Commonwealth magnates, especially those with estates and forces near the Russian border, began to look for a way to profit from the chaos and weakness of their eastern neighbour. This proved easy, as in the meantime many Russian boyars, disgruntled by the ongoing civil war, tried to entice various neighbors, including the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, into intervening. Some of them looked to their own profits, trying to organize support for their own ascension to the Russian throne. Others looked to their western neighbor, the Commonwealth, and its attractive Golden Freedoms, and together with some Polish politicians planned for some kind of union between those two states. Yet others tried to tie their fates with that of Sweden in what became known as the De la Gardie Campaign and the Ingrian War.\n\nAdvocates for a union of Poland–Lithuania with Russia proposed a plan similar to the original Polish–Lithuanian Union of Lublin involving a common foreign policy and military; the right for nobility to choose the place where they would live and to buy landed estates; removal of barriers for trade and transit; introduction of a single currency; increased religious tolerance in Russia (especially the right to build churches of non-Orthodox faiths); and the sending of boyar children for education in more developed Polish academies (like the Jagiellonian University). However, this project never gained much support. Many boyars feared that the union with the predominantly Catholic Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania would endanger Russia's Orthodox traditions and opposed anything that threatened Russian culture, especially the policies aimed at curtailing the influence of the Orthodox Church, intermarriage and education in Polish schools that had already led to successful Polonization of the Ruthenian lands under Polish control.\n\nThe Polish invasion (1605–1606)\n\nFor most of the 17th century, Sigismund III was occupied with internal problems of his own, like the Nobles' Rebellion in the Commonwealth and the wars with Sweden and in Moldavia. However, the impostor False Dmitry I appeared in Poland in 1603 and soon found enough support among powerful magnates such as Michał Wiśniowiecki, Lew, and Jan Piotr Sapieha, who provided him with funds for a campaign", "instruction": " What specific reasons drove Polish magnates, particularly Michał Wiśniowiecki, Lew, and Jan Piotr Sapieha, to support False Dmitry I during the Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618)?"}

{"topic": "Luís Gama", "document": "Luís Gonzaga Pinto da Gama (21 June 1830 – 24 August 1882) was a Brazilian  (self-taught lawyer), abolitionist, orator, journalist and writer, and the Patron of the abolition of slavery in Brazil.\n\nBorn to a free black mother and a white father, he was nevertheless made a slave at the age of 10, and remained illiterate until the age of 17. He judicially won his own freedom and began to work as a lawyer on behalf of the captives, and by the age of 29 he was already an established author and considered \"the greatest abolitionist in Brazil\".\n\nAlthough considered one of the exponents of , works such as Manuel Bandeira's \"Apresentação da Poesia Brasileira\" do not even mention his name. He had such a unique life that it is difficult to find, among his biographers, any who do not become passionate when portraying him - being himself also charged with passion, emotional and yet captivating.\n\nHe was a black intellectual in 19th century slave-owning Brazil, the only self-taught and the only one to have gone through the experience of captivity. He spent his life fighting for the abolition of slavery and for the end of the monarchy in Brazil, but died six years before these causes were accomplished. In 2018 his name was inscribed in the Steel Book of national heroes deposited in the Tancredo Neves Pantheon of the Fatherland and Freedom.\n\nPanorama from the time\nSão Paulo, where Gama lived for forty-two years, was in the middle of the 19th century a still small provincial capital that, with the demand for coffee production from the 1870s on, saw the price of slaves reach a level that made their urban possession almost prohibitive. Until this period, however, it was quite common the property of \"rent slaves\", on whose work their owners drew their source of sustenance, alongside the so-called \"domestic slaves\".\n\nIt had a population ten times smaller than that of the Court (Rio de Janeiro), and a very strong presence of legal culture because, since 1828, one of the only two law schools in the country had been established there, the Largo de São Francisco Law School, which received students from all over the country, coming from all social strata - besides the children of the rural oligarchy, members of the intellectual elite that was being formed at the time (Gama defined it, then, as \"Noah's Ark in a small way\").\n\nChildhood and slavery\nLuís Gama was born on June 21, 1830, at Bângala street Nº2, in the centre from the city of Salvador, Bahia. Even with little information about his childhood, it is known that he was the son of Luísa Mahin, a freed African ex-slave, and the son of a Portuguese fidalgo who lived in Bahia. At the age of seven, his mother traveled to Rio de Janeiro to participate in the Sabinada revolt, never to meet him again. In 1840, his father ended up in debt with gambling, so he resorted to selling Luís Gama as a slave to pay his debts. There is no evidence that his father sought him out after that. As an adult, Gama understood that when he was sold he was a victim of the crime of \"Enslaving a free person, who is in possession of his freedom.\", provided in Article 179 from Criminal Code of the Empire of Brazil, sanctioned shortly after his birth. Furthermore, due to the fact that the revolts that took place in Bahia led to the prohibition of the sale of slaves from this province to other regions of Brazil, the sale and transport of Luís Gama to São Paulo was constituted as contraband.\n\nIn an autobiographical letter he sent in 1880 to , he describes his birth and early childhood thus: \n\nLígia Ferreira, one of the researchers who has most studied Gama's life, points out that this information could not be verified, although she stresses that the sobrado where he was born still exists; the register of his baptism could not be found, and adds to this the fact that the omission of his father's name from his account casts doubt on his real identity.\n\nPut up for sale, he was rejected \"for being Bahian\". After the Malê revolt, a stigma was created that Bahian captives were rebellious and more likely to run away. He was taken to Rio de Janeiro where he was sold to Antonio Pereira Cardoso, a slave trader who took him to be resold in São Paulo. From the Port of Santos, Gama and the other slaves were taken on foot to be sold in Jundiaí and Campinas. With all the buyers resisting buying him because he was from Bahia, Gama began working as a domestic slave on the ensign's property, washing and ironing clothes, and then became a , working as a seamstress and shoemaker in the town of Lorena.\n\nFreedom and adulthood\nIn 1847, Luís Gama had contact with a law student, Antônio Rodrigues do Prado Júnior, who stayed at his master's house and taught him the alphabet. The following year Gama was already literate and had taught the ensign's children to read, which he used as an argument in favor of his alforria, which was not successful. With this, Luís Gama was able to prove his freedom and joined the army in 1848. It remains unclear, however, the artifices used by Luis Gama to obtain his freedom, and it is suggested that he may have used the testimony of his father - whose identity he was careful to keep obscure. There is also the theory that Gama would have run away from the estate and argued that he was free because he could read and write, which were skills that most slaves did not possess. He was part of the City Guard from 1848 until 1854, when he was imprisoned for 39 days due to \"insoburdination\" after \"threatening an insolent officer\" who had insulted him. Before that, in 1850, he had married Claudina Fortunata Sampaio.\n\nEven while serving in the army, he was chosen to work as a copyist for official authorities in his spare time, since he had good calligraphy. In 1856, he was hired as a clerk at the São Paulo Police Department, in the office of Francisco Maria de Souza Furtado de Mendonça, a counselor and law professor. With the knowledge of Francisco Mendonça and having his library at his disposal, Luís Gama further studied the subject of law until he made the decision to graduate from the Largo de São Francisco Law School. However, the students of the Faculty were against it, making it impossible for Luís Gama to enroll, so he began to study on his own, as attending classes as a listener and became a \"rábula\", the name given to the individual who had enough legal knowledge to be a lawyer, even without a law degree. After acting in slave cases, Gama was dismissed from his position at the Secretariat of Police, in 1868, due to pressure from  who were dissatisfied with the freedoms won by the rábula. Gama defined his dismissal \"for the good of the public service\" as a consequence of the work he had been doing to free slaves who were in an illegal situation, in addition to denouncing the system's abuses, or, in his words\n\nLiterature\n\nGama was a reader of the Vida de Jesus (Life of Jesus), by the French philosopher Ernest Renan, originally published in 1863 and soon translated in Brazil, being one of the first to refer to it in the country. His only work, originally published in two editions (1859 and 1861), Primeiras Trovas Burlescas, placed him in the literary pantheon of Brazil only twelve years after he learned to read.

{"topic": "RatSat", "document": "RatSat or DemoSat was an aluminum mass simulator on the fourth flight of the Falcon 1 rocket, launched on 28 September 2008. Ratsat remained bolted to the second stage of the carrier rocket after reaching low Earth orbit. It is an aluminium alloy chamber in hexagonal prism shape with 1.5 m (5 ft) length.\n\nThe Falcon 1 launch that carried Ratsat to orbit was the first successful orbital launch of any privately funded and developed, liquid-propellant carrier rocket, the SpaceX Falcon 1, something only six nations had successfully accomplished previously.\n\nThe launch, identified as Falcon 1 Flight 4, was conducted by SpaceX, and also marked the first time the Falcon 1 rocket successfully achieved orbit, after three consecutive failures on the three previous launch attempts.\n\nBackground \nThree consecutive flights of the Falcon 1 rocket had ended in failure. In particular, during the third launch of the Falcon 1 in August 2008, the first stage of the rocket after stage separation have residual thrust and slammed into its second stage, resulting in catastrophic damage to the second stage's Kestrel engine. Though the fix for the problem is simple – add a time delay between main engine cut off and stage separation – SpaceX was running out of money and there was much uncertainty that there will be a fourth flight for the company. As for SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk, he was in immense stress financially and personally, as both of his ventures, SpaceX and Tesla Inc., were at risk of bankruptcy due to a series of failures. He was also recently divorced with Justine Musk which after property settlement made him homeless, and also lost their first son due to SIDS.\n\nPreparation\n\nShipping to Omelek \nRight after the third launch failure, Musk made an encouraging speech for the SpaceX employees and told them to launch another rocket in six weeks. According to Musk, this tight schedule was necessary or else the company would be in bankruptcy. The rocket was built out of spare parts laying around in the factory.\n\nThe fourth launch of the Falcon 1 was supposed to deliver the Malaysian government's RazakSAT satellite, but the Malaysian government has backed out and no other customer was willing to launch on a thrice-failed rocket. Therefore, the SpaceX team had to make a non-functional aluminum boilerplate to simulate the rocket's payload. The boilerplate weighed  and named \"RatSat\" after the last names of Jeff Richichi, Ray Amador and Chris Thompson, who were part of the company's structures team. The design for RatSat's logo was inspired by Ed Roth t-shirts, whom Thompson admired.\nNormally, Falcon 1's first stage would be shipped by a container to Omelek Island, Kwajalein Atoll, U.S. (where SpaceX launched the rocket) and Falcon 1's second stage would fly out to the island using the Douglas DC-8 aircraft. The first stage was too big to be flown out using a DC-8. However, the tight schedule mandated the first stage to be shipped over air, so after scrambling with military contacts, a SpaceX employee was able to book a flight on the U.S. Air Force's Boeing C-17 Globemaster III with a price of $500,000. Being much larger than the DC-8, the C-17 can easily fit the rocket's first stage (which its dry mass weighs  compared to the C-17 carrying capacity of ) and twenty supporting employees.On 3 September, the C-17 landed at the Los Angeles International Airport near SpaceX's headquarters, loaded up, and took off without issues. An intentional small opening in the Falcon 1's oxygen tank fuel pressurization line was made to equalize the rocket's internal pressure with the surroundings. This approach worked well enough for the rocket tanks to slowly release its pressure while the plane was ascending. However, when it was time for the plane to descend to Hawaii and the cabin depressurized, the small opening did not allow air to pass into the rocket tanks fast enough. Thus, the Falcon 1 imploded, right next to the supporting crew. Had the SpaceX crews were not onboard the flight, the Falcon 1 would be ditched to the sea.\n\nWith only 30 minutes of fuel left and the rocket continued to crumble, the crew cut the shrink wraps with their knives and took the wrench in the toolbox. One of the crews crawled inside the Falcon 1's interstage (piece that connects the first and second stage of the rocket) with the wrench and detached a pressurization line inside, allowing air to pass inside. The crumbling oxygen tank was inflated back to shape, though it had sustained damages to its structure. The C-17 landed at the Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii at midnight; the SpaceX crews slept here because they forgot to book a proper resting location. The next morning, the crews and rocket took off from Hawaii and landed on an airstrip in the Kwajalein Atoll. A barge then carried the first stage of the rocket to the Omelek Island.\n\nRocket fixes and tests \nUsing a borescope, a slosh baffle was found detached from the tank body, and it was clear that the Falcon 1 needed a total disassembly. A 'proper' six-weeks long fixing procedure was proposed, but it was promptly rejected because by then, SpaceX would not have any funds and would be bankrupted. Another solution suggesting shipping back the rocket to the headquarters was also not viable for the same reason. The only viable option was to disassemble the rocket on the island itself, within one week. As the engineers were working on the rocket, a crew sen  \n\nThe Falcon 1 rocket was successfully test-fired on 20 September. Launch preparations on 23 September led the ground crew to replace part of a pipeline supplying liquid oxygen to the second stage Kestrel engine. This work delayed the launch to 28 September.\n\nLaunch\n\nThe launch occurred from Omelek Island, part of the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Liftoff occurred at 23:15 UTC on 28 September, 15 minutes into a five-hour launch window. If the launch had been scrubbed, it could have been conducted during the same window until 1 October. Nine minutes and 31 seconds after launch, the second stage engine shut down, after the vehicle reached orbit. The initial orbit was reported to be approximately . Following a coast period, the second stage restarted, and performed a successful second burn, resulting in a final orbit of  at 9.35° inclination.\n\nIt was Falcon 1's first successful launch, and the first successful orbital launch of any privately funded and developed, liquid-propellant carrier rocket.\n\nThe rocket followed the same trajectory as the previous flight, which had failed to place the Trailblazer, NanoSail-D, PRESat and Celestis Explorers spacecraft into orbit. No major changes were made to the rocket, other than increasing the time between first stage burnout and second stage separation. This minor change addressed the failure seen on the previous flight, recontact between the first and second stages, by dissipating residual thrust in the enhanced first stage engine in vacuum before separation.\n\nAlthough SpaceX was working on concepts to recover the first stage of Falcon 1 launch vehicles, as of this launch, they had not yet succeeded in doing so. Stage recovery was a non-primary goal of the early flights. SpaceX utilized an incremental development process to iterate the design issues of booster stage recovery. CEO Elon Musk stated that the probability of a successful recovery would increase with subsequent flights, however the Falcon 1 was subsequently retired from service after its fifth launch, with first stage recovery never having been accomplished successfully. The first stage of the successor rocket, the Falcon 9, became reusable.\n\nSee also\n\n 2008 in spaceflight\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n Photo section, page i-1 – i-16, at \n\nSpacecraft launched by Falcon rockets\nDerelict satellites orbiting Earth\nSpacecraft launched in 2008\nTest spaceflights", "instruction": " What is the specific weight of RatSat, the non-functional aluminum boilerplate used as a placeholder for the Malaysian government's RazakSAT satellite on the fourth Falcon 1 launch?"}

{"topic": "Relax (Deetah song)", "document": "\"Relax\" is a song by Chilean-Swedish singer-songwriter Deetah, co-written by Deetah and Anders Bagge. The song contains a prominent sample of \"Why Worry\" by British rock band Dire Straits, so Mark Knopfler also received a writing credit. Produced by Bagge and Bloodshy, \"Relax\" was included on Deetah's first studio album, Deadly Cha Cha (1999), and was released through FFRR Records as her debut single on 14 September 1998. Upon its release, the song became a top-20 hit in Iceland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In the UK, it entered the top 10 on both the Scottish Singles Chart and the UK R&B Singles Chart.\n\nBackground and release\n\"Relax\" was written by Anders Bagge and Deetah under her real name, Claudia Ogalde. The track's composition heavily samples the Dire Straits' 1985 song \"Why Worry\", so Mark Knopfler is also credited as a writer. Bagge, as \"Bag\", produced the song alongside Swedish DJ Bloodshy. Additional personnel who worked on the song include Mark \"Spike\" Stent, who mixed the track, and Arnthor, who engineered it. FFRR Records issued \"Relax\" as a single in the United Kingdom on 14 September 1998 across various formats. These releases contain \"Take Mines\" and various remixes of \"Relax\" as B-sides. CD singles were also issued in Sweden, Germany, South Africa, and Australasia. The song was included as the fourth track on Deetah's 1999 debut album, Deadly Cha Cha, and also appeared on the soundtrack to the 1998 slasher film I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.\n\nCritical reception\nBefore the song's release, British trade paper Music Week reviewed \"Relax\" on 29 August 1998, giving the song a \"side-thumb\" rating and noting that the \"Why Worry\" sample caused an \"ill effect\". Ziad from Record Mirror gave a positive review for the song's Bump 'n' Flex and M-Dub remixes, calling them \"excellent\" and giving them a five-out-of-five rating. British columnist James Masterton wrote that the song is a \"great example of commercial garage with enough hooks to help it cross over to a pop audience\", retrospectively calling its \"Why Worry\" sample \"groundbreaking\".\n\nChart performance\n\"Relax\" debuted at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart on the week beginning 20 September 1998, which would become its peak. It is Deetah's highest- and longest-charting UK single, spending eight weeks in the top 100. On the Scottish Singles Chart, the single entered the top 10, peaking at number 10 on 4 October. It was also a top-10 hit on the UK R&B Singles Chart, reaching number four for two weeks. The single's UK sales alone registered on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it debuted and peaked at number 47 on the chart dated 3 October.\n\nOutside the UK, \"Relax\" became a top-20 hit in Sweden and Iceland. In Sweden, it debuted at number 39 on the Hitlistan chart on 15 October 1998. Over the next three weeks, the song rose and fell within the top 30, then it jumped to its peak of number 20 on 12 November, becoming Deetah's first of three top-50 hits in Sweden. It remained on the ranking for five more weeks, logging 10 weeks in the top 60 altogether. On Iceland's Íslenski Listinn Topp 40 chart, \"Relax\" first appeared at number 37 on 9 October 1998.

{"topic": "Stanley Falkow", "document": "Stanley \"Stan\" Falkow (January 24, 1934 – May 5, 2018) was an American microbiologist and a professor of microbiology at Georgetown University, University of Washington, and Stanford University School of Medicine. Falkow is known as the father of the field of molecular microbial pathogenesis. \nHe formulated molecular Koch's postulates, which have guided the study of the microbial determinants of infectious diseases since the late 1980s. Falkow spent over 50 years uncovering molecular mechanisms of how bacteria cause disease and how to disarm them. Falkow also was one of the first scientists to investigate antimicrobial resistance, and presented his research extensively to scientific, government, and lay audiences explaining the spread of resistance from one organism to another, now known as horizontal gene transfer, and the implications of this phenomenon on our ability to combat infections in the future.\n\nEarly life and education\nFalkow was born into a Yiddish-speaking household in Albany, New York. His father was a shoe salesman and had immigrated from Soviet Kyiv, Ukraine. \nHis mother came from a family of Jewish immigrants from Poland. She \"rented several of their bedrooms and later opened a corset shop\". Falkow's family was working-class to poor as he described in his memoir. He was therefore a first-generation Jewish American. Falkow worked at a toy shop in order to collect enough money to buy a model microscope, as well as admitted to stealing textbooks, one a nurse's book on infectious diseases, in order to explore microbiology as a career path despite his family's financial situation.\n\nFalkow attributed his early interest in microbiology to reading Microbe Hunters in 1943, when he was 11 years old, which he found at the public library after the family had moved to Newport, Rhode Island. The book is a dramatization of microbiological research written by American microbiologist Paul de Kruif.\nBecause of poor grades until his senior year of high school, an adviser suggested military rather than college. Falkow described himself as an average student, and below average at mathematics, which he later rectified by working through workbooks of high school and college level mathematics later in his career, after earning his Ph.D., in order to analyze and design experiments. In his memoir, Falkow gives credit to his teachers and acknowledges the role that the systemic oppression of women in America in the 1940s-1950s played in his life, stating \"I now understand that I was the beneficiary of the repression of women by our society. The best and brightest women in many communities were relegated to the one intellectual role deemed suitable for them. They became teachers and many poured their love of language, science, music and art into students like me.\"\n\nEducation and career\nFalkow enrolled in biology at the University of Maine, because of their microbiology department. During the summers he worked in pathology at the hospital in Newport, staining slides and assisting in autopsies. He graduated in 1955.\nBefore he started graduate school at University of Michigan he developed extreme anxiety. He was later diagnosed with agoraphobia. He avoided movie theaters and crowded places between 1955 and 1983 and dropped out of his first attempt at graduate school because of recurring panic attacks. He returned to Rhode Island to live with his parents and work at the Newport Hospital as a technician, focusing on bacteriology and processing and examining patient samples. He re-enrolled in graduate school at Brown University and graduated with a PhD in 1961.\n\nHe finished his work for his Ph.D. thesis at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in the Department of Bacterial Immunology. While at Walter Reed, he worked with African-American microbiologist Othello Washington. Washington was older and more experienced than Falkow, but was assigned to be Stan's technician. Upon meeting, Falkow and Washington decided it would be more appropriate and better for both men to work together as a team. The two men worked together on isolating mobile genetic elements and the transfer of genes between E. coli and Salmonella and published a paper together about Proteus species. Falkow also worked with Shigella species and contracted dysentery, which lead to hospitalization, after being exposed to infected monkey feces flung at his face by an infected monkey. Multiple times through his training and early career more senior scientists, some Nobel prize winners, recommended that Falkow focus more on mechanisms of gene expression and less on pathogens because \"nobody cares about typhoid\". Falkow remained interested in pathogens despite many warnings from his peers and supervisors that infectious diseases were not interesting and were becoming less frequent in wealthy countries and were therefore a diminishing field of study.\n\nHis early work in the 1960s focused on the genetic mechanisms, which enable bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. He showed that organisms, such as Shigella, can possess DNA fragments called plasmids which exist apart from the bacterial chromosome, and that they carry specialized information for survival. Under selective pressure from antibiotics, one species of bacteria can pass its plasmids to another directly without mating, thereby preserving its own specialized survival genes.\n\nIn 1966, he joined Georgetown University School of Medicine as a professor of microbiology. He later moved to Seattle to join the faculty of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Here he described how meningitis and gonorrhea organisms acquire plasmids to become resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics.\n\nIn the 1970s, Falkow shifted his focus to the infection process. During this period, he showed that a life-threatening diarrhea prevalent in many developing countries is caused by a sub-type of E. coli. He also co-authored (with Royston C. Clowes, Stanley N. Cohen, Roy Curtiss III, Naomi Datta and Richard Novick) a proposal for uniform nomenclature for bacterial plasmids.\n\nIn 1981, he was named chairman of the Department of Medical Microbiology at Stanford University School of Medicine, a position he held until 1985. While at Stanford, Falkow encouraged Esther Lederberg to continue directing the Stanford Plasmid Reference Center, an internationally used registry for plasmids, transposons and insertion sequences.)\n\nPersonal life and death\nFalkow was married to Rhoda Ostroff in January, 1958 with whom he had two daughters. They divorced in 1983. In December, 1983, he married Lucy S. Tompkins.\n\nFalkow and Tompkins met while he was a professor at Georgetown University, and she was a medical student who sought Falkow out to work in his lab. At first, Falkow denied the opportunity to Tompkins, claiming that he would not take female graduate students because he was not comfortable having a female student, which was common in the scientific field in the 1960s. Tompkins rebutted his misogyny firmly, and explicitly pointed out that he was discriminating against her based on her gender. Her argument forced Stan to reconsider his bias and he then allowed her to enter his laboratory as a trainee. For the remainder of his career Falkow continued to hire women trainees, and by the end of his career most of his trainees were female. Falkow later became an advocate and ally of gender equality in science and helped encourage many women to pursue scientific careers.\n\nFalkow had on-going severe anxiety throughout his career. Due to his anxiety early in his career he avoided conferences, airplanes, and giving presentations in general due to the fact that he would shake and sweat noticeably during them. Falkow described his struggle with his mental health as an \"uneasy truce\" with his \"demons\" later on in his career as he learned various coping mechanisms. Because of his anxiety during public speaking, he often employed humor in his teaching and presentations to help cope with the tension of a silent audience, which also lead to most of the audience members finding his talks memorable and enjoyable. Falkow kept his condition a secret from his colleagues during his early career, only privately revealing to Arthur Saz, the chair of microbiology at Georgetown University School of Medicine, that he received and benefited from psychoanalysis treatment. Health insurance for mental health treatment was much better for military employees than academics at the time, and a major reason Falkow continued to work at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research for as long as he did early in his", "instruction": " What specific discoveries or advances in microbiology did Stanley Falkow make related to molecular microbial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance beyond what has been mentioned in the provided text?"}

{"topic": "Lathyrus", "document": "Lathyrus  is a genus of flowering plants\nin the legume family Fabaceae, and contains approximately 160 species. Commonly known as peavines or vetchlings, they are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America. There are annual and perennial species which may be climbing or bushy.  This genus has numerous sections, including Orobus, which was once a separate genus. The genus has numerous synonyms, including Pisum, the ancient Latin name for the pea.\n\nUses\nSeveral species are grown for food, including the pea (Lathyrus oleraceus), Indian pea (L. sativus), and the red pea (L. cicera), and less commonly cyprus-vetch (L. ochrus) and Spanish vetchling (L. clymenum). The tuberous pea (L. tuberosus) is grown as a root vegetable for its starchy edible tuber. The seeds of some Lathyrus species contain the toxic amino acid oxalyldiaminopropionic acid and if eaten in large quantities can cause lathyrism, a serious disease.\n\nMany species are cultivated as garden plants.

{"topic": "Fukche", "document": "Fukche Advanced Landing Ground  is an airfield in the Demchok sector of the union territory of Ladakh, India. It was built shortly before the 1962 Sino-Indian War and was revived in 2008. It is located adjacent to Koyul, 34 km northwest of Demchok.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Fukche Landing Ground is in the Koyul Lungpa river valley, close to the confluence of the river with the Indus River (called \"Sengge Zangbo\" locally). The Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, which runs along the Indus River, is only  2.5 kilometres away. Beyond the LAC is Chinese-controlled Demchok sector up to the Chang La pass (also called Xingong La).\n\nThere is a regular highway from Fukche to Dungti and beyond (leading to Leh and Chushul), and an unmetalled road to Demchok, 34 km southeast at the southern tip of the Indian-controlled Demchok sector.\n\nChina runs a \"Sengge Zangbo highway\" adjacent to the LAC and a \"Kigunaru highway\" going to Chang La and beyond.\n\nHistory\nThe landing ground was first prepared in 1961 in advance of the 1962 Sino-Indian war. It was the sixth such landing ground to be prepared in Ladakh, starting with Leh in 1948 (which was in the midst of the First Kashmir War). According to a retired Army officer, \"The Landing Grounds were built on grounds that were hard, barren and sandwiched between almost a range of parallel running mountains. At most places it was a question of removing boulders, filling potholes and generally leveling the ground. The good old infantry equipment of a pick axe, shovel and crow bar came in very handy.\"\n\nAfter the 1962 Sino-Indian war, the airstrip fell out of use. It was reopened on 4 November 2008 by the Indian Air Force, when an AN-32 transport aircraft was successfully landed there.\nThe reactivation of the landing ground, along with another reactivation of the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip earlier in May of the same year, allows Indian forces to deploy faster and in greater numbers, which China is believed to have taken as a threat. During the 2013 Depsang standoff, China demanded the bunkers being constructed at Fukche be stopped. But the Indians pointed out the constant upgrading of the Chinese infrastructure on their side of the LAC. In the end, the Chinese disengaged at Despang without insisting on concessions regarding Fukche.\n\nFacilities\nThe airfield has an unpaved gravelly runway of 2 miles length. It accommodates small transport aircraft, meant for inducting or recycling troops at the border.\n\nRoad connectivity\n\n\"Chushul-Dungti-Fukche-Demchok Highway\" (CDFD road), along the southern bank of Indus river which marks the LAC, will be converted to a single-lane 7.45 m wide 135 km long national highway with paved shoulder by 31 March 2025. Chushul and Fukche Airstrips lie along this highway. It will also provide faster access to the Nyoma airbase.\n\n\"Likaru-Mig La-Fukche Road\" (LMLF Road), through 19,400 ft Mig La, commencement of construction was announced by the BRO on 15th August 2023. After the completion, it will overtake the \"Chisumle-Demchok Road\" (via Umling La, 19,300 ft) to become the highest motorable road in the world. Road via Umling La already passes at a height higher than the base camp of world's tallest mountain, the Mount Everest.\n\nSee also\n List of Indian ALGs\n India-China military deployment on LAC\n India-China Border Roads\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n Air Marshal K.

In his first season with the North Lincolnshire club, they reached the Division Four play-off final, in which they faced Blackpool at Wembley. The match went to a sudden-death penalty-shootout, in which White, who was a second-half substitute for Tony Daws, sent his effort high over Blackpool goalkeeper Steve McIlhargey's crossbar to hand promotion to the Lancastrians. In his two years with Scunthorpe, White made 68 league appearances and scored 16 goals.\n\nWhite joined Scarborough in 1994. He spent one year with the club, making 63 league appearances and scoring twenty goals. He was named Scarborough's Clubman of the Year. In 1995, he signed for Northampton Town, making a total of 77 league appearances and scored 18 goals. Two years later, he was on the move again, this time to Rotherham United making a total of 73 league appearances and scored 22 goals.\n\nCheltenham Town came in for his services in 2000, and in his three years at Whaddon Road, he made 31 league appearances and scored only one goal, against Leyton Orient.

{"topic": "Cabralism", "document": "Cabralism is the period from 1842 to 1846 when António Bernardo da Costa Cabral dominated Portuguese politics. Cabralism was characterized by the adoption of the constitutional doctrine contained in the restored Constitutional Charter of 1826, which was taken as a dogma to be scrupulously respected, thus creating a stable framework that was exploited by the government. The government was characterized by being a strong executive, decisively supported by the royal powers enshrined in the Charter, especially the reserve power vested in the sovereign.\n\nHistory\n\nWith the express support of Queen Maria II, of whom Costa Cabral was considered a valedictorian, the government's parliamentary front was secured by an obedient majority, congregated in an exclusivist party and committed to maintaining, against the onslaughts of the left and the remnants of Miguelism, the order deemed necessary for the country's development.\n\nOne of the first reforms of Cabralism was administrative centralization, approving the Administrative Code of 1842. This was followed by the reform of Portugal's National Guards, one of the previous factors of instability, the resumption of relations with the Holy See and the control of foreign debt and the government deficit.\n\nCabralism attempted to launch an ambitious public works program, creating public-private partnerships with the creation of state creditor companies. On the social front, it legislated on public education and health, trying to modernize these sectors.\n\nHaving to take out a loan of 2400 escudos, an astronomical sum at the time, he was forced into a tax reform aimed at increasing state revenue, which began a rapid process of erosion of the popular support base for the government.\n\nIn a clear show of favor, Queen Maria II appointed Costa Cabral an effective Councillor of State (1843), a Peer of the Realm (1844) and elevated him to Count of Tomar (1845), for two lives. However, the rapid enrichment of Costa Cabral, who, from the position of a modest lawyer, in a few years became the holder of a considerable fortune, which included a palace capable of hosting the Queen, as well as the nepotism of which he was accused, since his brother José Bernardo da Silva Cabral, also made 1st Count of Tomar, was also accused of nepotism. Silva Cabral, who also became the 1st Count of Cabral, was one of the government's supporters (hence the name government of the Cabral), making Costa Cabral a figure hated by vast swathes of the population. When his other brother and his father also entered parliament, accusations of nepotism, clientelism and concussion in public tenders grew.\n\nWhen, in January 1846, the unstoppable increase in public spending and the consequent state deficit led to the state's credit being cut off, making bankruptcy imminent, Cabralism fell into agony. Thus, despite having completed the legislature, and having been the first government of Portuguese liberalism to achieve this feat, popular discontent was such that the slightest agitation threatened to result in an uprising. This is what happened in the spring of 1846 with the Maria da Fonte Revolution.\n\nThe end of Cabralism\nFaced with the spread of the popular uprising, the Queen was forced to dismiss Costa Cabral, who went into exile to Madrid. That was the end of Cabralism.\n\nDespite all its shortcomings and corruption, in the end Cabralism was a necessary stage in Portuguese liberalism. Costa Cabral consolidated the liberal state, based on strong centralization and a complex bureaucracy. Based on the army, freemasonry, of which Costa Cabral was Grand Master of the Lusitanian Grand Orient, and clientele who benefited from the economic and financial policy, based on public works and development, Cabralism laid the foundations of the current Portuguese state, and many of its features have survived to the present day.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\nBonifácio, Maria de Fátima, História da Guerra Civil da Patuleia 1846-1847, Editorial Estampa, Lisboa, 1993 (ISBN 9723309270)\nCapela, José Viriato; Borralheiro, Rogério, A Revolução do Minho de 1846 e as reformas da administração.

{"topic": "Sympulse", "document": "Sympulse is an annual international college cultural festival at Symbiosis Centre for Management Studies (SCMS) Pune, founded in 2010. It spreads across a span of five days held in the first quarter of every year. It attracts students from junior, under-graduate and post-graduate colleges as participants. It is an exposure into different categories of talent, for example: Business and Management, Model United Nation Conference, Showcasing artistic ability in cultural extravaganzas, and Sports. These categories have been personalized to suit the fest and the events take place simultaneously over those five days.\n\nEach year has a new theme. Previous themes have been: City Beats, Medieval Mayhem, Theatre of Transition, Spirit of Celebration, Element Entourage, Escape to Neverland, Chrono Drift, Local Coalesce, Elemental Entourage, and Cinematic Odyssey. The Theme for 2020 was Cultural Medley.\n\nSymbiosis Centre for Management Studies, Pune\nSymbiosis Centre for Management Studies – a constituent unit of Symbiosis International University was formerly introduced as Symbiosis BBA on 12 July 2004 in Pune. The institute is ranked among the top BBA courses in the nation under the guidance of Dr. Bhama Venkataramani. About 6000 students apply for 240 seats annually.\n\nThe 5 wings of Sympulse\nIn 2010, SCMS-UG held four separate college fests with different objectives: Ananya, Sprint, SIMUNC and Symulate. Ananya was focused on cultural activities, Sprint was focused on sport-related activities, SIMUNC was focused on global topics and Symulate was focused on business-related activities. In 2010 the student council decided to merge them and create a single, larger fest called Sympulse. These four fests became wings of Sympulse, and their events were held simultaneously across the five days. Over time, Sympulse grew into five distinct wings (Ananya, Symulate, Sprint, Headline Events, and SIMUNC).\n\nAnanya\nAnanya is the cultural wing which encourages creativity and artistic expression through the events it hosts. It's also the largest cultural fest in Pune. It is known to be the living embodiment of a fun element of Sympulse because it plays host to various cultural art forms and ideas. \nThe list of categories it covers is given below:\n Literary arts\n Fine arts\n Performing arts\n Showcase events\n Gaming\n Workshops\n Informals\n On the spot events\n\nThe events held within each category are not standardized, therefore each year the committee has new events to suit the theme of Sympulse along with previously successful events.\n\nHeadline Events\nHeadline Events is the glamour wing of Sympulse. It is often compared to the gilded world of movies and music, as it showcases the best lofty elements of its participants. They host events like:\n Pit stop: A show case of international cars and bikes from all over Maharashtra. These automobiles are showcased in the college campus.\n Battle of the bands (BOTB): BOTB showcase nationally renowned bands like demonic resurrection, family cheese and workshop.\n War of the DJ: The participant DJs play what they have to offer, competing with each other and the crowd enjoys and judges the best mixes.\n Pronite: A celebration the Indian cinema and music. \n Texas Hold’em: Where poker is played like a sport.\n\nSIMUNC\nSIMUNC, the Symbiosis International Model United Nation Conference, is a personalized version of Model United Nations. SIMUNC compels students to act responsibly, think critically, and make wise decisions It is, in essence, a simulation of the UN and its committees, with contemporary, historical, and, frequently, futuristic perspectives. Students are given an opportunity to converge from all over the world in a dynamic environment to deliberate on global issues, acting as delegates representing the various member states of the UN.\n\nSprint\nSprint is the sport wing of Sympulse. It was one of the four initial wings of Sympulse, and generally has the highest participation of all wings. The events are categorized into the following sports:\n Basketball\n Football\n Street football\n Boxing\n Badminton\n Table tennis\n And a lot more\n\nSymulate\nSymulate is the business and management wing of Sympulse. Symulate begins with the ‘academic summit’, where eminent personalities from different sectors like corporate, sports, media and politics come together to enlighten students on a pre-decided topic. This is followed by events which test the participants' knowledge with management and other business-related activities. It gives participants a common platform to compete and showcase their talents in events ranging from Finance and Human Resource to a variety of team events. It accommodates participants from various colleges for a span of five days where every college contingent battles for the top spot. The events held by Symulate are:\n Best Manager\n Finance\n Best Entrepreneur\n Marketing\n Human Resources\n Business Plan\n Business Quiz\n Strategy\n\nThrough the years\n\nSympulse10===\nThis was the first year when Sympulse was held. The theme was City Beats. The 4 initial wings of Sympulse – Ananya, Sprint, SIMUNC, and Symulate – embraced the theme and created events within each category to suit the theme. With City Beats as its theme, it aimed to celebrate the epitome of human civilization, the manifestation of man's very soul, and the pinnacle of ambitious vision: a City.\nThere were 30 international participants and 800 international participants; hence a total of 830 participants.

He was recognised as a young talent while he played for younger selections in Zrinjevac and Rudeš. His debut for Cibona came against Široki in 2007–08 Adriatic League season. He played a total of 8 minutes and managed to gather up 4 points by getting a three pointer and one free throw scored. After that he played nine more games for Cibona in the Adriatic League. His season highlight was 7 points and 1 rebound in 10 minutes spent on court against Crvena zvezda.\n\nAt the start of 2008-09 season, Krušlin was offered a loan move to aid his development. Cibona has already signed five more guards that season which did not guarantee much play time for Krušiln. He was then loaned to another club from Zagreb, Dubrava.

He participated and perished in the ill-fated Denmark expedition to NE Greenland in 1906.\n\nThe Denmark expedition\nHøeg Hagen, together with expedition leader Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen and the Greenlander Jørgen Brønlund, was part of the team of dogsleds that aimed to explore the Independence Fjord area from the east. Misled by existing maps, the three men prolonged their journey to such an extent that a return to the ship at Danmarkshavn that spring was impossible.\n\nThe three of them were forced to spend the summer in the desolate area without the necessary footgear for hunting in the stony ground. The need for food for men and dogs forced them to reduce their three dogteams to one. Finally in September they were able to start their return journey on the new frozen sea ice along the coast, but when they arrived at the southern shore of Mallemuk Mountain, they found open water and were forced to travel inland. Hagen perished of starvation, exhaustion, and cold while walking on the ice in the Nioghalvfjerdsbrae area, followed by Mylius-Erichsen a few days later.\n\nThe last to die was Brønlund, his body, together with his diary and Hagen's cartographic sketches were found next spring by  Johan Peter Koch in Lambert Land. Some cairn reports, left at Danmark Fjord by Mylius-Erichsen, were found and brought to Copenhagen by Ejnar Mikkelsen in 1912.\n\nHagen Fjord, a southern branch of Independence Fjord, as well as Hagen Glacier, were named in his honour.\n\nSee also\nDenmark Expedition Memorial\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Memorial to Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen (1872-1907), Niels Peter Høeg Hagen (1877-1907) and Jørgen Brønlund (1877-1907)\n\n1877 births\n1907 deaths\nDanish cartographers\nDanish polar explorers", "instruction": " What specific causes led the Denmark expedition, including Niels Peter Høeg Hagen, to become stranded and ultimately perish during their exploration of NE Greenland?"}

{"topic": "The Lion and the Witch", "document": "The Lion and the Witch is a live EP  by American rock band Weezer. Recorded in Japan in the spring of 2002 while promoting Maladroit, released on September 24, 2002, exactly six years after the release of Pinkerton. It was distributed as a limited edition release in independently owned music stores with only 25,000 copies having been made. The album was then rereleased and remastered on vinyl in 2015, with only 3,000 copies made.\n\nLike Maladroit the marketing of this EP caused a rift with Weezer's record label Geffen Records. The band wanted an eight-song EP with a unique packaging that would not involve crystal cases. Geffen told the band that the packaging idea was too expensive and the number of songs on the EP needed to be reduced from eight songs to six as to not upset the other retailers who would not be receiving the disc. The artwork and packaging stuck but the disc's length was reduced to six songs including a \"hidden track\": an instrumental track titled \"Polynesia\" that opens the disc.\n\nRecording \n\nWhile recording the EP, the band makes two errors on this live disc. Rivers Cuomo accidentally begins singing the third verse of \"El Scorcho\" during the second verse and Scott Shriner, who had been in the band for less than a year at the time of this show, forgets the words in the bridge to \"Holiday,\" causing the other members of the band to crack up. After the performance is through, Cuomo muses \"Scott just won a Grammy!\" In addition to that error, the last track is thirty seconds shorter than what the band intended and there is a noticeable cut off on the finished disc. None of the music is missing, but there was more after-song commentary that the band wanted on the disc. The full version of this track was released shortly thereafter on the band's website in mp3 format.\n\nArtwork \n\nThe cover art was designed by Los Angeles-based duo kozyndan. The liner notes of the album have a number of fan letters from Japanese Weezer fans in broken English. The notes also list production credits for Rupert Peasley, who is known among fans as the man on the couch on the cover of Maladroit, and E.O. Smith, which is a pseudonym for Rivers Cuomo, who went to E.O. Smith High School. Only 25,000 individually numbered copies of the disc were made apparently some fans have copies of the disc with numbers over 25,000. As noted at the band's website, the numbering was disrupted by printing difficulties with the cardboard sleeve.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n\n Rivers Cuomo – lead vocals, guitar\n Patrick Wilson – drums\n Brian Bell – guitar, backing vocals\n Scott Shriner – bass, backing vocals\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n\n2002 EPs\nLive EPs\n2002 live albums\nGeffen Records live albums\nGeffen Records EPs\nWeezer EPs", "instruction": " What is the exact reason why the numbering of the individually numbered copies of The Lion and the Witch EP was disrupted?"}

{"topic": "Corte de' Frati", "document": "Corte de' Frati (Cremunés: ) is a municipality (comune) in the province of Cremona, in the Lombardy Italian region.\n\nHistory \nThe main history of Corte de' Frati is related to the establishment of the Court of Alfiano. In fact, the original name of the municipality was Court of Alfiano, a name referring to a patrician family who owned these lands.\n\n10th century \nAfter the extinction of the Carolingian and the Saxon dynasty, the 10th century was the era of castles and fortress, and the population had to face wars provoked by the Counts. From 950 to 1000, the Bresciani and Cremonesi  Counts fought among the lands of the river Oglio, near Bordolano and Canneto, because the Bresciani imposed taxes on the Cremonesi's lands. During this period, the castle of Corte De' Frati was born, but now it does not exist anymore.\n\nOn 1004, Henry II conquered Brescia and the Court of Alfiano belonged to the Santa Giulia Monastery in Brescia.\n\n13th century \nDuring the 13th century, a bridge was built by the Cremonesi people near Grumone, a frazione of the nowadays Corte de' Frati, in order not to pay the toll bridge enforced by the Bresciani on the bridge of Pontevico. This new project gave life to a war between the two dynasties: in 1213 the Bresciani ordered to the Cremonesi that the bridge was to be destroyed because it was built on the Brescian territory. The bridge, however, was not destroyed until 1228, when Alfiano was assaulted by an armed conflict between Bresciani and Cremonesi, during which the majority of warriors died and those who survived were imprisoned. Afterwards, the two dynasties did not resume their hostilities for a long time because in 1237 the territory was occupied by Frederick II, who used the contested bridge to move easily around Cremonese territory.\n\nIn the first half of the 13th century, under the pontificate of Pope Innocent III, the Italian religious order of Humiliati was born and in 1246 they held the Saint Abbondio Church in Cremona. The Humiliati also took possession of Alfiano, whose name was transformed into Corte de' Frati.\n\n14th century \nDuring the 14th century, the raids by the Bresciani on the territory started again, and the Cremonesi's raids were mostly done in Pontevico. The city of Cremona strengthened the cities near the Oglio river to avoid new conflicts.\n\nIn 1324, Louis IV reconfirmed to the Cremonesi all the privileges and rights previously granted by their predecessors. This event led to new hostilities and disagreements with the Bresciani.  Facing a rivalry that was never going to end, the archbishop of Milan Giovanni Visconti issued a law stating that the toll fee of Pontevico's bridge was unmodifiable.\n\n15th century \nThe beginning of the 15th century faced a new armed conflict between the lord of Brescia Pandolfo Malatesta, and the lord of Cremona Cabrino Fondulo. Pandolfo came to the Cremonese territory with an army and took possession of Robecco, Alfiano, Corte de' Frati and other villages near the Oglio river. In 1413 a peace treaty was signed and the Cremonesi reclaimed their lands. At the end of the century, however, the Republic of Venice conquered Brescia and Cremona.\n\n17th century \nAfter the suppression of the Humiliati at the beginning of the 17th century, in 1614 the pope Paul V ordered the establishment of the Perpetual Vicar. In this period the world was facing the bubonic plague, and in 1630 Corte de' Frati registered 253 deaths, which was a high number considering that the inhabitants were only 1,000. Facing a high number of deaths, the parish decided to build a new cemetery, because the bodies used to be buried near to the church.\n\nIn 1648, a trench called \"Trincerone\" was built by the Marquis Caracena, governor of Milan, to avoid the siege of Cremona by the French. It started from Cremona and ended in Grumone, and it was 10 miles long. In the same year, however, the Cremonesi managed to free the city from the French siege.\n\nThe municipality of Pontevico persisted with the toll bridge, and this inevitably led people coming from the Cremonese territory to use the river from Alfiano to avoid the tax fee. In April 1671 the city of Brescia issued a proclamation suspending the use of the river as a way to avoid the Pontevico's bridge.\n\nIn 1683 the present-day church of Corte de' Frati was built above the old castle's foundation.\n\n18th century \nAt the beginning of the 18th century, the municipality was hit by a very high mortality rate of bovine animals. Meanwhile, the lands of Grumone, Corte de' Frati and Robecco were continuously damaged by the raids. From 1777 to 1780 there was a high rate of famine, and the century ended again with an epizootic.\n\n19th century \nThe 19th century started with the French conquering Cremona and its territories, and they also took refuge on Corte de' Frati for three months. In 1802 an earthquake hit the municipality and the church was damaged. During these period, thanks to Napoleon, the streets were fixed and a postal service was activated. Corte de' Frati, Alfiano, and Aspice relied on the municipality of Robecco.\n\nIn 1816 there was a high rate of drought that led to famine, and the following year the petechial typhus was spreading through the peasants. This disease was probably caused by the previously mentioned famine, and the deaths were almost 150. In 1867 a cholera outbreak was registered once again. In the same year, the rail line Cremona-Brescia was built, and the river Oglio lost his main function of trade exchange.\n\nEconomy \n\nThe local economy is mostly based on agriculture and industrial activities. The territory is well known for its dairy farms and for its metal industry. Food is related to the city of Cremona, including salted meat, Grana Padano and different types of local fruits and vegetables coming from the local farms.\n\nTransport \n\nCorte de' Frati is linked both to the city of Cremona and to the city of Brescia, thanks to the bus service offered in the area.\n\nGovernment\n\nNotes \n1.

Richards and his supporters accordingly contested the election under the banner of the Parliamentary Labor Party. The official ALP, consisting of the party administration, several dissident MHAs and much of the party grassroots, ran a mostly new slate of candidates. A number of MHAs and party officials also formed a third faction, the Lang Labor Party, associated with the ideas of New South Wales Premier Jack Lang.

{"topic": "Powerplay (cricket)", "document": "A powerplay is the name for the fielding restrictions in limited overs cricket. It was first introduced in 1980-81 Australian season. Fielding Restrictions has been a rule in ODI cricket since 1992. It was renamed as Powerplay by ICC in 2005.\n\nUnlike Test cricket, the fielders are spread out to save runs in limited overs cricket. The powerplay rules along with a number of other factors, has contributed to the big scores in modern One Day Internationals since 1992.\n\nRules\nOne Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 differ in terms of the number of overs where mandatory powerplay rules apply.  The rules below apply only when a match is uninterrupted.\n\nODI\n During the first 10 overs of an innings, a maximum of two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle (27 metres). This is called the 1st powerplay.\n Between overs 11 and 40, a maximum of four fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. \n In the final 10 overs (41–50), a maximum of five fielders will be allowed to field outside the 30-yard circle.\n\nTwenty20\nIn most domestic leagues and international Twenty20 cricket, the first six overs of an innings will be a mandatory powerplay, with only two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle.  Beginning with the seventh over, no more than five fielders will be allowed outside the 30-yard circle. However, in the Big Bash League the Powerplay is only the first 4 overs, with the batters choosing when the same restrictions apply for 2 overs in the second half of the innings, in a period called a Powersurge.\n\n100-ball cricket\n\nThe powerplay restrictions are active during the first 25 legal balls of the innings, with only two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle.\n\nHistory\nFielding restrictions evolved through the 1970s, notably in World Series Cricket, and were first introduced in ODIs in 1980 in Australia. The most common rule was for only two fielders to be allowed outside the circle in the first fifteen overs, then five fielders allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs.\n\nThe powerplay nomenclature was introduced by the International Cricket Council in 2005, when the fielding restrictions were split into 3 blocks: the mandatory ten overs at the start of the innings and two further five-over powerplays with the bowling team being able to choose the timing of both. In practice though, both were generally taken as soon as possible, effectively leading to a single block of 20 overs of fielding restrictions. To counter this, in 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays.\n\nFrom 1 October 2011, the ICC brought additional changes to the bowling and batting powerplays. Under the new rules, in a 50-over match, neither of the two five-over powerplays may be taken before the start of the 16th over and both must be completed before the commencement of the 41st over, so overs 11 to 15 and 41 to 50 cannot be powerplay overs.  Should either or both teams choose not to exercise their discretion, their powerplay overs will automatically commence at the latest available point in the innings (e.g. in a 50-over innings with one unclaimed powerplay, it will begin at the start of the 36th over).\n\nOn 29 October 2012, the ICC made further amendments on powerplays, reducing the number of blocks of powerplays from three to two.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2012, during non-powerplay overs a total of five fielders were allowed outside the circle. This was changed to four in October 2012. Moreover, from 1992 to 2005, two fielders were required in catching positions in the first fifteen overs. This was reduced to the first ten overs in July 2005.\n\nFrom 5 July 2015, the ICC further amended the rules, making the whole innings as a composition of 3 powerplays, thus removing the batting powerplay previously introduced. Furthermore, the restriction of two catching fielders on the first powerplay was relaxed.\n\nReferences \n\nCricket terminology", "instruction": " What is the exact configuration of powerplays in a Twenty20 cricket match, including the number of overs with fielding restrictions and the number of fielders allowed outside the thirty-yard circle?"}

{"topic": "Acoustic quieting", "document": "Acoustic quieting is the process of making machinery quieter by damping vibrations to prevent them from reaching the observer. Machinery vibrates, causing sound waves in air, hydroacoustic waves in water, and mechanical stresses in solid matter. Quieting is achieved by absorbing the vibrational energy or minimizing the source of the vibration. It may also be redirected away from the observer.\n\nOne of the major reasons for the development of acoustic quieting techniques was for making submarines difficult to detect by sonar. This military goal of the mid- and late-twentieth century allowed the technology to be adapted to many industries and products, such as computers (e.g. hard drive technology), automobiles (e.g. motor mounts), and even sporting goods (e.g. golf clubs).\n\nAspects of acoustic quieting\nWhen the goal is acoustic quieting, a number of different aspects might be considered. Each aspect of acoustics can be taken alone or in concert so that the end result is that the reception of noise by the observer is minimized.\n\nAcoustic quieting might consider...\n Noise generation: by limiting the noise at its source,\n Sympathetic vibrations: by acoustic decoupling,\n Resonations: by acoustic damping or changing the size of the resonator,\n Sound transmissions: by reducing transmission using many methods (depending whether the transmission is through air, liquid, or solid), or\n Sound reflections: by limiting the reflection using many methods,  e.g. by using acoustic absorption (deadening) materials, trapping the sound, opening a \"window\" to let sound out, etc.\n\nBy analyzing the entire sequence of events, from the source to the observer, an acoustic engineer can provide many ways to quieten the machine. The challenge is to do this in a practical and inexpensive way. The engineer might focus on changing materials, using a damping material, isolating the machine, running the machine in a vacuum, or running the machine slower.\n\nMethods of quieting\n\nMechanical acoustic quieting\n Sound isolation: Noise isolation is isolating noise to prevent it from transferring out of one area, using barriers like deadening materials to trap sound and vibrational energy. Example: In home and office construction, many builders place sound-control barriers (such as fiberglass batting) in walls to deaden the transmission of noise through them.\n\n Noise absorption: In architectural acoustics, unwanted sounds can be absorbed rather than reflected inside the room of an observer. This is useful for noises with no point source and when a listener needs to hear sounds only from a point source and not echo reflections. Example: In a recording studio, sound proofing is accomplished with bass traps and anechoic chambers. Wallace Sabine, an American physicist, is credited with studying sound reverberations in 1900, and Carl Eyring revised his equations in 1930 for Bell Labs. Another example is the ubiquitous use of dropped ceilings and acoustical tiles in modern office buildings with high ceilings. Submarine hulls have special coatings that absorb sound.\n Acoustic damping: Vibration isolation prevents vibration from transferring beyond the device into another material. Damping mounts have progressed in the industry to offer vibrational resistance in many degrees of freedom. Recent advances include shock isolators damping in at least six degrees of freedom. Acoustic damping also has uses in seismic shock protection of buildings. Motors and rotating shafts are commonly fitted with these mounts at the points where they contact the building or the chassis of a large machine.\n Acoustic decoupling: certain parts of a machine can be built to keep the frame, chassis, or external shafts from receiving unwanted vibrations from a moving part. Example: Volkswagen has registered a patent for an \"acoustically decoupled underbody for a motor vehicle.\". Another example: Western Digital has registered a patent for an \"acoustic vibration decoupler for a disk drive pivot bearing assembly.\".\n Preventing stalls: Whenever a machine undergoes an aerodynamic stall, it will abruptly vibrate.\n Preventing cavitation: When a machine is in contact with a fluid, it may be susceptible to cavitation. The sounds of gas bubbles imploding is the source of the noise. Ships and submarines which have screws that cavitate are more vulnerable to detection by sonar.\n Preventing water hammer: In hydraulics and plumbing, water hammer is a known cause for the failure of piping systems. It also generates considerable noise. A valve that abruptly opens or shuts is the most common cause for water hammer.\n Shock absorption: Just as automotive shock absorbers are used to prevent mechanical shocks from reaching the passengers in a car, they are also important for quieting shocks.\n Reduction of resonance: Essentially any piece of metal or glass has certain frequencies to which it is susceptible to resonate. A machine that resonates would make a tremendous noise. Resonance also occurs in enclosures, such as when echoes reverberate in an ocarina or the pipe of a pipe organ.\n Material selection: By choosing nonmetallic components, the transmission of sound and vibrations can be minimized. For example: instead of using rigid brass fittings, a machine using flexible plastic pipe fittings may be much quieter. In some cases air can be evacuated from a machine and sealed hermetically, the vacuum inside becoming a barrier to sound transmission. In cases where porous plastic materials are used in acoustic applications, the porosity of the plastic is adjusted to either dampen specific wavelengths or for minimal sound loss in a speaker grill cover.\n\nQuieting for specific observers\n Underwater acoustics: All of the above types of acoustic quieting apply to submarines. Additionally, a submarine may employ a tactic that prevent sounds from reaching a listener at a particular ocean depth. Operating below the depth of the sound channel axis, where the speed of sound in water is the lowest, a submarine can prevent detection by surface ships, unless these ships use equipment like a towed array and/or an underwater drone to place hydrophones below the sound channel axis.\n Sound refraction: Just as a submarine can use refraction to hide its acoustic signature from surface vessels, the same principle of sound refraction can be used to prevent certain observers from hearing the noise. For example, an outdoor observer close to the ground will have sound waves refracted toward him when the ground is cooler than the ambient air and away from him when the ground is hotter than the air.\n Sound redirection: One of the obvious ways to reduce the received sound level of an observer is to place the observer out of the path of the highest amplitude sounds. For example, if we mark off a circle around a jet engine and make sound power level observations along that circle, we would expect that the sound is loudest directly in line with the jet's exhaust. Observations perpendicular to the exhaust would be significantly quieter.\n Hearing protection: An observer may be forced to wear ear plugs in areas of high ambient noise levels. This may be the only quieting method available in areas of noise pollution, such as an open-air firing range or an airport.\n\nElectronic quieting\n Electronic vibration control: Electronics, sensors, and computers are now employed to reduce vibration. Using high speed logic, vibrations can be damped quickly and effectively by counteracting the motion before it exceeds a certain threshold.\n Electronic noise control: Electronics, sensors, and computers are also employed to cancel noise by using phase cancellation which matches the sound amplitude with a wave of the opposite polarity. This method employs the use of an active sound generating device, such as a loudspeaker to counteract ambient noise in an area. See noise-canceling headphone. Workers in noisy environments may favor this method over ear plugs.\n Noise reduction: In sound and video equipment, noise reduction is the process of removing noise from a signal. This is strictly for electronic noise or noise which has been detected and put into electronic form.\n Noise canceling: If both the noise and the signal are received by an electronic or digital medium, noise can be filtered from the signal electronically and retransmitted without the noise. See noise-canceling microphone. Helicopter pilots rely on this technology to speak on the radio.\n\nSee also\n Acoustic signature\n Noise reduction, for electronic noise\n Sound masking, for noise masking by saturation\n Pink noise\n Stealth technology, for signature reduction in general\n Longitudinal wave\n Soundproofing\n Mechanical resonance\n Sound masking\n Seismic retrofit\n Helicopter noise reduction\n Muffler\n Deperming\n Degaussing\n\nReferences\n\nAcoustics\nNoise control\nStealth technology", "instruction": " What are some effective materials and methods for acoustic decoupling in automobile engines to minimize vibrational transmission and improve overall quietness?"}

{"topic": "Tornel", "document": "Tornel or Hulera Tornel is a Mexican enterprise and only surviving Mexican tire manufacturer in Mexico, dedicated to making tires and other automotive industry-related products. Founded in 1933 by Mexican businessman Armando Tornel, who in October 2006 entered the Worldwide Tire Industry Hall of Fame. Hulera Tornel is the top Latin American tire manufacturer, and one of the largest tire manufacturers currently active in the world.\n\nHistory\nCompañía Hulera Tornel is a Mexican tire manufacturer currently part of JK Tyre group of India. \n\nCompañía Hulera Tornel was originally founded by the Tornel family, one of the oldest families in Mexico, renown in the Mexican industry and society. The company was founded by Isauro Tornel Toriz and his eldest son, Armando Tornel Murillo, native from El Salto de Juanacatlán, Jalisco, Mexico. Armando entered the tire business when he was only 15 years old, while working as a tire seller at the same time he was studying in the night school of San Indelfonso in Mexico City. Years later, his father Mr. Isauro Tornel Toriz decided to send Armando to the United States, where he pursued a technical career in Tire Engineering at Smithers Laboratories, and rubber technology at Vanderbilt Laboratories, gaining technical and practical experience at Goodyear and Mohawk, both in Akron, Ohio. Upon Armando´s return to Mexico during 1933, he partnered with his father and his younger brothers Salvador and Raúl, and together they opened a tire-sale business with 27 employees, at a store located at Hidalgo Avenue number 91, in the historic downtown area of Mexico City. \n\nIn 1937, the Tornel family business was formalized via incorporation of Compañía Hulera El Centenario, company that manufactures and marketed at the time tires under the America and All States brands. In 1940 the Tornel family associated with Firestone through a joint venture, changing the name of the company to \"Cía. Hulera Firestone Centenario\". Some years later, the Tornel family decided to sell their stock to Firestone, and independently pursued continuity in the tire business on their own by incorporating the wholly owned Compañía Hulera Tornel (Tornel Rubber Company), manufacturing tires as well as rubber and supplies for tire repair. \n\nUnder Compañía Hulera Tornel, Armando assumed the position of Chair of the company’s board, while his brothers Raul and Salvador occupied other key positions as senior members of the company's Board of Directors until their deaths. In the 1950s Compañía Hulera Tornel entered other sectors and started manufacturing bicycle tubes and also devised new manufacturing techniques. In 1968 it expanded to manufacturing bicycle tires as well.\n\nCompañía Hulera Tornel remained in the Tornel family for 4 generations.\n\nDevelopment, consolidation and sale to the JK Group\nIn the 1970s the company started to grow dramatically within the closed economy then existing in Mexico, and also began to compete with other national tire companies like General Popo, Euzkadi, and the oldest of all, Hercules. At this time Compañía Hulera Tornel began to launch most of its modern products such as the tire tubes manufactured with point technology and dabbled in making tires for trucks and buses.\n\nThe 1980s brought a crisis to the Mexican economy due to devaluations that caused the closing of Tornel's competitors:  General Popo, Euzkadi and Hercules.  When the company saw these closings, they paid attention and steered the business toward specializing in the retail vehicle and truck sales niche.  This move allowed them to adapt and later thrive in the market. The closing of these competitor factories allowed Tornel free rein in the market but not for long since soon after competition began from foreign tire manufacturers which would turn out to be aggressive commercial rivals, such as Goodyear, Bridgestone, Michelin, Firestone, and BFGoodrich. However, despite the incursion of foreign companies, the market position and Tornel prestige was not diminished. After four generations of members of the Tornel family running the company, in 2008 Compañía Hulera Tornel was acquired by JK Tyre of India.\n\nToday\nIn May 2008, Tornel was purchased by India-based JK Tyre for $68 million. JK Tyre is an Indian tyre manufacturer that is about the 23rd largest in the world. It intends to use Tornel as the base for its approach to the North American market taking advantage of the NAFTA, and is investing in molds to manufacture tires under both the Tornel and JK brands. Tornel has a total of three manufacturing facilities, all within the metropolitan area of Mexico City.  Before the sale of the company, the Tornel family assisted to the ceremony in Las Vegas, Nevada where Armando Tornel was granted a place in the Tire Industry Association Hall of Fame in October 2006.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official site\n\nTire manufacturers of Mexico\nMexican brands\nManufacturing companies established in 1933\nMexican companies established in 1933", "instruction": " What specific productivity improvements or innovations did Compañía Hulera Tornel implement during the 1950s when they started manufacturing bicycle tubes and bicycle tires?"}

Human Rights Act, sexual identity and gender identity and expression are among its defined protected traits. Discrimination against these traits is illegal in housing, in employment, in public accommodations, and in educational institutions.\n\nIn 1973, the D.C. government passed Title 34, an expansive human rights law that prohibited discrimination against many protected traits, which included sexual orientation. The city became among the first in the United States to offer discrimination protections to LGBT people. The law was incorporated into the D.C. Human Rights Act in 1977. In 1989, Congress passed an amendment to the Human Rights Act, named after Senator William L. Armstrong, that permitted religious schools to discriminate against students based on sexual orientation. The D.C. government successfully repealed the Armstrong Amendment in 2015. The act was also amended in 2006 to include gender identity and gender expression as protected traits.\n\nIn June 2012, the D.C. government passed the Youth Bullying Prevention Act, which requires businesses serving youth to have clear anti-bullying policies. The law specifically adds protections for bullying of LGBT youth and children of LGBT parents. It went into effect in September.\n\nIn late 2020, the D.C. government passed a law that amended the D.C. Human Rights Act to add discrimination protections for LGBT seniors and seniors living with HIV in long-term care facilities. The law went into effect in January 2021.\n\nHate crime law\nThe District's hate crime law covers both sexual orientation and gender identity. It provides additional penalties for crimes motivated by the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity, amongst other categories.\n\nGay panic defense\nThe gay panic defense, a controversial legal strategy that claims a victim's sexual orientation or gender identity and/or expression is to blame for a defendant's violence, including murder, has been illegal in the District of Columbia since May 2021. At the time of passage, eleven other states had already banned the defense.\n\nIn September 2019, members of the D.C. Council introduced two bills to alter the city code by abolishing the gay panic defense. The bills used the term \"heat of passion\" to describe the panic defense. The bills were referred to the council's Judiciary and Public Safety Committee to be merged and by November 2020, the committee advanced the resulting bill to the full council. Named the \"Bella Evangelista and Tony Hunter Panic Defense Prohibition and Hate Crimes Response Amendment Act of 2020\", it is named after two LGBT people who were killed in the district. Bella  Evangelista was a trans woman who was shot and killed by a 22-year-old man in 2003; Tony Hunter was a gay man who was killed during an assault by an 20-year-old man in 2008. The men charged in the two cases attempted to use the gay panic defense. The council unanimously passed the bill in December, and Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the bill in January 2021. It was reported in January that the government might lack the necessary funds to fully implement the law. The Associated Press reported in February that the attack on the U.S. Capitol had delayed several pieces of legislation from taking effect, including the law abolishing the gay panic defense. After many delays, the law went into effect in May 2021.\n\nCivil litigation and other reforms\nThe District of Columbia has a pending law that would ban a judge or jury from devaluing personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, among other protected classes. The \"Stormiyah Denson-Jackson Economic Damages Equity Act of 2022\" was named after a 12-year-old Black girl who committed suicide at a D.C. boarding school and whose wrongful death lawsuit was devalued. It was passed by the D.C. Council in October 2022 and signed by Mayor Muriel Bowser in November.\n\nTransgender rights\n\nGender on identity documents\nOn identity documents issued by the District of Columbia, transgender people can amend the gender marker to reflect their correct gender identity, and they do not need to undergo gender-affirming surgery to do so. Nonbinary people can amend the gender marker on their driver's license to the third gender option \"X\", but not for other identity documents.\n\nIn 2013, the D.C. government enacted the JaParker Deoni Jones Birth Certificate Equality Amendment Act of 2013, which allows D.C. residents to obtain a new birth certificate reflecting their gender identity so long as they provide a letter from a licensed health care provider certifying the resident's change in gender identity. It repealed an existing provision that required the resident to undergo gender-affirming surgery. The law was named after JaParker Deoni Jones, a trans woman who was murdered in 2012. D.C. became the sixth jurisdiction in the United Statesbehind Oregon, California, Vermont, Washington, and a portion of the federal governmentto ease name changing rules for transgender people.\n\nIn 2016, the D.C. government unanimously approved the \"Death Certificate Gender Identity Recognition Amendment Act of 2016\", a law that was proposed the year before but failed, which allows a transgender person's gender identity to be properly recorded on their death", "instruction": " What laws protect transgender individuals from discrimination in employment in the District of Columbia?"}

{"topic": "2012 Glasgow City Council election", "document": "Elections to Glasgow City Council were held on 3 May 2012, the same day as the other Scottish local government elections. The election was the second using 21 new wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, each ward elected three or four councillors using the single transferable vote system form of proportional representation.\n\nThe election in Glasgow attracted the most attention out of the local elections in Scotland as there were many predictions that the Scottish Labour would lose control of the council due to losses of seats to the Scottish National Party. The Labour administration had suffered from a number of defections of council members to the newly formed Glasgow First party and controversy surrounding Councillor's salaries and contracts. In the end, Labour remained in control, losing just one seat, while the SNP gained five. The Scottish Liberal Democrats were reduced to holding just one seat on the council, the same numbers as the Scottish Conservatives (who retained their solitary seat) and Glasgow First. The Scottish Greens retained five seats on the authority.\n\nAfter the elections Labour again formed a controlling administration on the City Council.\n\nElection result\n\nNote: \"Votes\" are the first preference votes. The net gain/loss and percentage changes relate to the result of the previous Scottish local elections on 3 May 2007.

{"topic": "NextSense", "document": "NextSense, formerly the Royal Institute for Deaf & Blind Children, in Sydney  provides a range of educational services for students with vision and/or hearing impairment, including specialist schools for signing Deaf students, oral deaf students, and students with sensory and intellectual disabilities.\n\nNextSense offers additional services such as therapy and braille text production, a children's audiology centre, and also conducts research and professional development through its RIDBC Renwick Centre. Historically it is an important centre of Deaf culture in Australia.\n\nNextSense was opened on the 22 October 1860 by deaf Scottish immigrant Thomas Pattison, who was the school's first teacher. Located at 152 Liverpool St Sydney, the school was originally named the \"Deaf and Dumb Institution of New South Wales\". From its early days it was open to all deaf children, though many were turned away for lack of resources. Sydney was still a young city at the time, with only 80,000 inhabitants; the University of Sydney had been established a mere ten years prior and public education was in its infancy. The school began to take in blind students in 1869, and added the word \"blind\" to its name. It was predominantly a boarding school, and moved many times within central Sydney to accommodate more students as the school grew, including stints in Paddington and Newtown, before finding its present home in North Rocks in 1962. It currently operates several educational centres on New South Wales and offers some national services.\n\nDavid Hunter, a former student of the school who had been blind from age 6, was elected as member of the NSW parliament (for Ashfield) when he was 35 and served there for 35 years (1940–1976). He was responsible for the passing of an Act in 1944 to make the education of blind and deaf children compulsory. Another well-known student was Alice Betteridge, the first Australian deafblind child to receive an education. She enrolled in 1908 at the age of seven where she learned to read and write, graduating as dux in 1920.\n\nSchools within RIDBC\nToday there are three specialist schools within RIDBC:\n The RIDBC Alice Betteridge School, for children with sensory and intellectual disabilities (renamed from \"The Special School for Multi-handicapped Blind Students\" in 1990).\n The RIDBC Garfield Barwick School, for \"oral\" deaf children who communicate using speech and assisted hearing. Opened in 1988 as a primary school to prepare deaf students for a mainstream high school.\n The RIDBC Thomas Pattison School, which provides education in Auslan, Australia's Deaf sign language. Established in 1992 as the \"Thomas Pattison Annexe\", renamed as a school in 1997.\n\nChildren's services that RIDBC provide\nRIDBC also runs a number of early childhood services.  These include home based, centre based and remote early education programs for children up to 5 years who have sensory disabilities, as well as five special preschools (RIDBC Hunter Preschool, RIDBC Nepean Preschool, RIDBC VisionEd Preschool, RIDBC Roberta Reid Preschool, RIDBC Rockie Woofit Preschool) and support for children with sensory disabilities enrolled in mainstream preschools.\n\nIn 1997 RIDBC was pleased to announce a new program known as RIDBC Teleschool, which combines the existing Remote Early Learning Programs for vision impairment and hearing impairment.\n\nIn addition to its direct services, RIDBC aims to help as many deaf and blind children as possible through its RIDBC Renwick Centre, for research and professional education of those educating children with sensory disability.  The RIDBC Renwick Centre is conducted in conjunction with the Macquarie University and offers a range of post-graduate courses (including a Master of Special Education in Sensory Disability) and continuing education activities.  The RIDBC Renwick Centre attracts students from across Australia and internationally.\n\nCommunity Support\nRIDBC is a major Australian charity but relies heavily on Government subsidy and community support to continue its services.

{"topic": "Neverwinter Nights", "document": "Neverwinter Nights is a series of video games developed by BioWare and Obsidian Entertainment, based on the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. Aside from also being set around the city Neverwinter, it is unrelated to both the 1991 Neverwinter Nights online game and the 2013 online game called Neverwinter.\n\nOverview \nThe Neverwinter Nights series take place primarily in the city of Neverwinter, located in the Sword Coast region of the fictional land of Faerûn. Also commonly referred to as the City of Skilled Hands, Neverwinter grew from a multi-racial settlement named Eigersstor founded several hundred years prior to the start of Neverwinter Nights. At the time the first game takes place, the city of Neverwinter was beset by a magical plague named the Wailing Death, whereas in the second game the city is threatened by an invasion from its ancient enemy named the King of Shadows.\n\nGameplay \nThe Neverwinter Nights series is a franchise of role-playing games with a third-person isometric perspective. The systems of the games are based on the rules of Dungeons & Dragons, a table-top role-playing game originally developed by TSR, Inc. Both Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2 contain three game modes: a default campaign, a multiplayer mode, and custom contents.\n\nCampaign \n\nBoth Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2 include a default campaign, which focus on the development of the player character through a series of distinct acts. In addition to the main story, the player also has the opportunity to undertake a variety of side quests, some of which form storylines that span the entire game. The player has the ability to make key choices in specific quests can affect combat encounters, key plot points, and the outcome of the overarching story.\n\nBefore the player can begin the campaign, they must first create a new character through the game's character creation interface. The player may customize a new character from scratch, or select one of the pre-set characters provided by the games. If the player chooses to create a new character, they are then guided through a series of choices about their character, including race, class, appearance etc.. Some of the choices such as gender and appearance are purely cosmetic, whereas others such as race and class affect how the player character fights and what abilities they have access to.\n\nCustom content \nIn addition to the base campaign and the multiplayer mode, both Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2 also included sets of software development tools which allow the players to create custom campaigns which they can then share with other players. Neverwinter Nights shipped with the Aurora Toolset, while Neverwinter Nights 2 shipped with the Electron Toolset, which was completely rewritten by Bioware using the programming language C#.\n\nReception \nThe first instalment in the series, Neverwinter Nights, was generally well received according to review aggregator Metacritic, which gave it a score of 91/100 based on 34 critic reviews and a score of 8.1/10 based on 608 user reviews. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game's accessibility, calling it \"one of those exceedingly rare games that has a lot to offer virtually everyone, even if they aren't already into RPGs\". Gamezone appreciated the game's graphic and sound design, and that \"the musical score foreshadows game action (the music picks up in intensity when combat looms), and is well done\". Allgame reviewer Mark Hoogland commended the Aurora toolset shipped with Neverwinter Nights, calling the breadth of level, story, environment, and module creation options \"impressive\". Eurogamer reviewer Gestalt was less convinced, criticising the single-player campaign's emphasis on combat encounters over \"actual roleplaying\", but was optimistic that the game's mod support will give it longevity.\n\nLegacy \nThe Neverwinter Nights series has been adopted by a number of educators for use in the classroom. University of Alberta's Professor Mike Carbonara and colleagues made use of the Aurora Toolset to develop an \"economics game\" aimed at teaching the concepts of fixed price commerce, mark up, and supply and demand. Squire & Jenkins at MIT Education Arcade created the multiplayer game Revolution, which allows players to roleplay characters with different dispositions and political views in 1770s colonial Williamsburg, with an aim to improve the student's understanding of the American Revolution. In 2005, researchers Nora Paul and Kathleen A. Hansen designed a custom module for journalism students; players took on the role of a journalist investigating a train derailment in the fictional American town named Harperville, during which they must investigate and analyse multiple sources.\n\nGames \n\n A \"premium module\" is a small-scale, stand-alone adventure.\n An \"adventure pack\" is similar to the first game's premium modules.\n\nReferences \n\n \nVideo game franchises introduced in 2002", "instruction": " What unique features were added to the Aurora Toolset and Electron Toolset between Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2?"}

{"topic": "Tërbaç", "document": "Tërbaç is a community in the Vlorë County, southwestern Albania. At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Himarë.\n\nLocation\n\nThe village is located at the foothills of the Ceraunian Mountains and is adjacent to the village of Dukat, Brataj, Mesaplik, Vranisht, Palasë, Dhërmi. The area is rugged and mountainous, and is host to many streams and passes.\n\nHistory\nThe origins of the village are tied to the Qafa e Shengjergjit, which was used in ancient times as a caravan route between the ancient city of Orikum and more inland cities, where we can mention Hora, Cerje, Amantia, etc. In the Tërbaç river, there are found the legs of the ancient bridge 2500–3000 years old of Bogdan. But there are also toponyms in Tërbaç like \"Pellazg Tomb\" or \"Elim's Neck\", which shed light on the idea that it has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Between the two mountain ranges, Akrokeraune and Lungarë, where the Akrokeraune are hit by the Karaburun mountain range, lies the divine village of Tërbaç. From the data found in the village of Tërbaç, from some excavations from 1969, they showed a settlement of the 4th century BC and earlier. There were earthenware vessels, a bronze atelier figure, bronze coins with Zeus-bolt and Zeus-snake. This Information was taken by An archaeological look at the Shushica valley (Damian Komata). The coins found in Tërbaç are unique and together with the coins found in Amantia, are the main and only coins of the period of Amants. The bronze atelier found in Tërbaç means that the inhabitants of this great place were civilised since the beginnings of civilization. Tërbaç is also known about its unique kind of dog in the world, the strongest dog \"Molos\", ore Tërbaç dog. This kind of dog was used by Aleksandër the Great. It is also known for its fauna and flora and for the many contrasts of weather, relief, geology, etc. This territory is known from prehistoric dates till nowadays for bravery, wisdom, hospitality, trust and a lot of other virtues. In the Middle Ages, in Shengjergj, there was a great civilization, verified by ceramics in every corner of the village, by toponyms and other archaeological evidence. Eventually the trail of Qafa e Shengjergjit was forgotten by merchants and now it is only used by sheepherders in contemporary times and by tourists sometimes.\nIn 1537, in the anti-Ottoman uprising of Labëria, a discourse was recorded, expressing the bravery of the people of this village and their victory over the forces of the Great Empire. Turkish dominance over the area was minuscule, but taxes in the form of herds and other commodities were taken by the local Ottoman administration. Villagers often ignored the taxes that the local Sanjak in Vlorë requested, thus in around the 1820s an Ottoman expeditionary force skirmished with the villagers and stole their goods as compensation for neglect of taxes. \nAnother rare act of bravery is that of the brave Miro Strati Tërbaçi, an orphaned girl, who, in revenge for her brother who was treacherously killed by the Ottomans, got up and went to the barber and told him to shave her like a boy. After that, she took a horse and went to the Pasha of Berat and gave him two bullets, one in the chest and one in the forehead, and fought with those who followed her to save herself. The event took place in 1828. She died many years later. Tërbaç was part of the battlefield of the battle of Gjorm, where Albanian resistance units defeated and routed the troops of the Kingdom of Italy.

He holds the Canadian record for the most time spent in space (204 days 18 hours). He became an officer of the Order of Canada (OC) in 2013 and was named to the Order of British Columbia (OBC) in 2012.\n\nLife\nThirsk is from New Westminster, British Columbia and is married to Brenda Biasutti of Montreal, Quebec. They have three children: Lisane Biasutti Thirsk, Elliot Biasutti Thirsk, and Aidan Biasutti Thirsk. He enjoys spending time with his family, as well as flying, hockey, squash, and playing the piano.\n\nHe is a member of Professional Engineers Ontario, the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute, the Aerospace Medical Association, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, and the International Space University.\n\nHe won the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta Gold Medal in 1976, and was the first recipient of the University of Calgary Distinguished Alumni Award (1985). In 1997, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Professional Engineers of Ontario and was awarded honorary membership in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia.\n\nEducation\nThirsk attended primary and secondary schools in British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba, attending Glenayre Elementary School (Port Moody, B.C.), R. T. Alderman Junior High and graduating from Calgary's Lord Beaverbrook High School. His post-secondary education began with receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Calgary in 1976, and continued with a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1978, an M.D. from McGill University in 1982, and his MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1998 as a Sloan Fellow. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Calgary while in orbit on July 8, 2009. Fellow ISS crewmember Koichi Wakata  placed the convocation cape on Thirsk, which was later removed due to it constantly floating up to his face. This event made Thirsk the first person ever to receive a university degree from space. In 2019, Thirsk was awarded an honorary D.Eng. from Carleton University in recognition of his outstanding career as a Canadian astronaut, his many contributions to scientific and health research, and his promotion of science education and lifelong learning.\n\nCSA career\nThirsk was in the family medicine residency program at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Montreal when he was selected in December 1983 by the National Research Council of Canada to join the Canadian astronaut program. He began astronaut training in February 1984 and served as backup payload specialist to Marc Garneau for space shuttle mission STS-41-G, which flew October 5 to 13, 1984.  He has participated in several parabolic flight experiment campaigns on board NASA's KC-135 aircraft and has been involved in various projects relating to space medicine, the International Space Station, mission planning, and education with the Canadian Space Agency. He led an international research team investigating the effect of weightlessness on the heart and blood vessels. His team designed and tested an experimental \"anti-gravity suit\" that may help astronauts withstand the effects of extended spaceflight on the cardiovascular system.\n\nHe served as Chief Astronaut of the Canadian Space Agency in 1993 and 1994. In February 1994, he was crew commander for the CAPSULS mission, a simulated 7-day space mission that involved the participation of several international investigators and three other Canadian astronauts. In 1994–95, Thirsk completed a sabbatical year in Victoria, British Columbia. During this year, he improved his skills in clinical practice, space medicine research and Russian language training.\n\nOn June 20, 1996, Thirsk flew aboard space shuttle mission STS-78 (the life and microgravity Spacelab mission) as a payload specialist. During this 17-day flight aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, he and his six crewmates performed 43 experiments devoted to the study of life and materials science. Most of these experiments were conducted within the pressurized Spacelab laboratory module situated in the orbiter's payload bay. The life science experiments investigated changes in plants, animals and humans under spaceflight conditions. The materials science experiments examined protein crystallization, fluid dynamics, and high-temperature solidification of multi-phase materials in microgravity.\n\nWhile on STS-78, Thirsk wrote two columns for the Calgary Sun newspaper. This was the first occasion in which an astronaut wrote and filed a story to a newspaper—and had it published—while the astronaut was still in orbit.\n\nIn 1998, Thirsk was assigned by the Canadian Space Agency to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston to pursue mission specialist training. This training program involves advanced instruction on both shuttle and space station systems, EVA (spacewalking), robotic operations, and Russian language. Within the NASA Astronaut Office, Thirsk served as a CapCom (capsule communicator) for the International Space Station (ISS) program. CapComs participate in actual and simulated space missions as a communication link between the ground team at Mission Control and the astronauts in orbit. CapComs speak directly with the space station crew, and assist with technical planning for the mission and last-minute troubleshooting.\n\nIn October 2004, Thirsk served as the commander of the NEEMO 7 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days.  As a back-up crewmember, Thirsk replaced fellow CSA astronaut Dafydd Williams, who had previously served as an aquanaut on the NEEMO 1 mission, due to Williams undergoing review of a temporary medical issue.  Williams eventually served as the commander of NEEMO 9 in April 2006.\n\nIn 2004, Thirsk trained at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre near Moscow and became certified as a flight engineer for the Soyuz spacecraft. He served as backup flight engineer to European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Roberto Vittori for the Soyuz TMA-6 taxi mission to the ISS in April 2005. During the ten-day mission, Thirsk worked as Crew Interface Coordinator (European CapCom) at the Columbus Control Centre in Germany.\n\nThirsk was a member of the Expedition 21 crew on the International Space Station. He launched as a flight engineer on the Soyuz TMA-15 Soyuz mission on May 27, 2009, as a member of the Expedition 20 crew. He was the first Canadian astronaut to fly on a Soyuz. About this mission, Thirsk is quoted saying \"It will be the supreme thrill of my life. Throughout the mission I will examine the long-term effects of zero gravity as both a test subject and a physician. My findings will undoubtedly contribute to the future understanding of space station living.\" He returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-15 in November 2009.\n\nDuring the ISS 20/21 flight, he was visited by two other Canadians: Julie Payette (Space Shuttle Endeavour STS 127) and space tourist Guy Laliberté on Soyuz TMA-16 at the end of September 2009. The meeting between Thirsk and Payette in July 2009 was the first time two Canadians met in space. He and the Soyuz TMA-15 crew returned to Earth December 1, 2009.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, Thirsk was awarded the Russian Medal \"For Merit in Space Exploration\" – for outstanding contribution to the development of international cooperation in crewed space flight. In 2012, he was made a Member of the Order of British Columbia and in 2013 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada\n\nPost-CSA career\n\nFrom August 2012 to February 2014, Thirsk worked for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research as Vice President, Public", "instruction": " What specific experiments did Robert Thirsk conduct onboard the Space Shuttle during STS-78 mission?"}

{"topic": "Dieter Senghaas", "document": "Dieter Senghaas (born 27 August 1940 in Geislingen an der Steige) is a German social scientist and peace researcher.\n\nBiography \nAfter studying political science, social science, philosophy and history from 1960 to 1967, Senghaas received his doctorate in Frankfurt in 1967. His dissertation, Kritik der Abschreckung (Criticism of Deterrence), dealt with the field which has characterised his scientific activities since then: international relations, especially peace research, research on developing countries and conflict research. His studies were followed by work as an assistant at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt until 1968, and then a research residency in the USA with Karl W. Deutsch at Harvard University, among others, until 1970. From 1972 until 1978, Senghaas was leader of a research group at the Hessische Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung (Hessian Foundation for Peace and Conflict Research) and professor at the University of Frankfurt during that same period. Since 1978, he has been a professor at the University of Bremen and also active there at the Institut für interkulturelle und internationale Studien (Institute for Intercultural and International Studies). In 1986/1987 and 1992/1994, Dieter Senghaas was a research professor at the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (Foundation of Science and Politics). Since 1995, Senghaas has been a member of the advisory council of the Bundesakademie für Sicherheitspolitik (Federal Academy for Security Policies) in Bonn. In 1999, Senghaas was awarded the Göttinger Friedenspreis (Göttingen Peace Prize) of the Dr. Roland Röhl Foundation.\n\nScientific work\n\nWork concerning the East-West conflict \nIn the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, Senghaas took a close look at the armament dynamics and the system of deterrence in the East-West conflict. Senghaas recognised an autistic structure in the deterrence situation of the Cold War, which according to Senghaas, was mostly driven from the inside and less from the outside (international processes). Senghaas' criticism of deterrence and his analysis of armament dynamics and control contributed to the development of critical peace research.\n\nWork concerning the North-South conflict \nIn his three compilations, \"Imperialismus und strukturelle Gewalt (1972)\" (Imperialism and Structural Power), \"Peripherer Kapitalismus. Analysen über Abhängigkeit und Unterentwicklung (1974)\" (Peripheral Capitalism. Analyses of Dependency and Underdevelopment) and \"Kapitalistische Weltökonomie. Kontroversen über ihren Ursprung und ihre Entwicklungsdynamik (1979)\" (Capitalistic World Economy. Controversies about its Origin and its Development Dynamics), as well as in his 1977 book, \"Weltwirtschaftsordnung und Entwicklungspolitik. Plädoyer für Dissoziation\" (World Economic Order and Development Policy. Plea for Dissociation), Senghaas attempts to make visible the structural dependency of the periphery on the metropolises, or stated more simply, the dependence of the developing countries (or areas) on the political and economic power centers in the age of world economy. Senghaas sees a solution to the impediments to development, created externally (pressure of the industrial countries) and internally (interests of the power elite in keeping the existing societal structures), in a decoupling (not severance!) at times from the world market. In this decoupling phase, the concentration should be upon the development of the economic form of the developing countries, which should be the satisfaction of the local population, if possible exploiting local resources (with which Senghaas does not mean striving for economic self-sufficiency). With this way of looking at things, Senghaas also simultaneously rejected the idea prevalent at that time that simply integrating the Third World into the existing world economic order could solve the development problems of the Third World. As of the middle of the 1970s, Senghaas attempted to strengthen his theory by analysing the developing socialist countries of Albania, the People's Republic of China, North Korea and Cuba. For Senghaas, socialism did not represent a post-capitalist production system. Much more (independently of the intentions of the respective leader or regime), socialism could accomplish an economic development, which would not have been possible in that way under capitalistic conditions. In his analysis, Senghaas came to the conclusion that the development of states proceeded positively in the beginning, but then came increasingly to a standstill due to the absence of reforms, a more and more complex system of business and society and an increasingly inflexible political order (results in the middle of the 1980s). From the results of the analysis, several country monographs and an article on the status of socialism regarding historical development were created in cooperations with Frankfurt graduate students. Dieter Senghaas decisively left his mark on the discussion of theoretical development within international relations in Germany with his works about the possibilities of independent development processes in dependency of the given international conditions (economic and political).\n\nThe civilizational hexagon \n\nDieter Senghaas' \"civilizational hexagon\" joins load-bearing building blocks together for a stable maintenance of peace. This peacekeeping and its supervision of itself is regarded as a civilising project. The hexagon consists of six building blocks, which are all linked to each other, since they all depend on each other. A fundamental building block is the monopoly on the use of force, which means the de-privatisation of force and its authorization, that is, \"disarmament of the citizens\". The next building block, the rule of law, comprises the control of the monopoly of force, which has as a precondition that the public monopoly of force is not despotically abused. Since without a check on the monopoly of force, it would be nothing less than a dictatorship. The third building block, democratic participation, means democratic involvement of the public in elections and other decision making, since without this right of the people to contribute, they would not obey the professed laws. The trust of the people must also be secured by equal rights, so that they comply with such regulations. This occurs, among other things, through the building block of social justice, which provides for a just verdict from a neutral court when there is a violation of the law, but also takes care of safeguarding the basic necessities of every person. The next building block falls under the heading of constructive conflict culture, which describes the capability for tolerance in a multi-cultural society and a willingness for compromise-oriented conflict solution. The last building block of the hexagon is interdependencies and control of emotion. The purpose of this building block is the mutual dependency among people and their control of themselves in conflict situations.\n\nPublications \n\nAbschreckung und Frieden.

{"topic": "John Ingram Lockhart (writer)", "document": "John Ingram Lockhart (1812–1889) was an English writer and translator. He is known also for his involvement in radical politics.\n\nLife\n \nHe was son of James Lockhart, born in Hawkshead, at that time in Lancashire. Brought up in Haarlem, he encouraged his school friend Nicolaas Beets to translate Lord Byron. They also read Walter Scott and Laurence Sterne together. Lockhart in 1877 published a translation of a tale from Beets's 1839 work Camera Obscura, as \"The Leyden Eel-bobber\".\n\nA Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, as his father was, in 1838 Lockhart was listed at the same address, Lanhams in Berkshire. In 1839 he contested  as a radical candidate, nominated by John Gibbs. Charles John Baillie Hamilton was elected, Lockhart coming second ahead of George Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Nugent. In 1846, when Donald Maclean who was a sitting MP for Oxford suffered bankruptcy, he put himself forward as a replacement, on a policy platform of six points: (a) abolition of church rates, (b) change in the Poor Laws, (c) abolition of primogeniture, (d) dissolution of the church courts, (e) extension of suffrage, and (f) full civil and religious liberty. He signed from Pomona Place, Fulham. His chances as a prospective candidate were affected by newspaper reports of a fight in a third-class railway carriage, which he had entered in a party with the Rev. William Langley and others.\n\nLockhart spoke at a broad-based reform meeting in London in March 1852. He was then a Chartist candidate in the 1852 general election for , where two Liberals were elected. At a disorderly meeting in November 1853 at the National Hall, Holborn, for an anniversary of the November uprising, supporters of George Julian Harney and Lockhart clashed to try to gain the chair. In 1855 Lockhart was a speaker for the National Reform League, in July for the State Reform Association, and in December of that year he spoke at a meeting chaired by Francis Bennoch on the Bank Charter Act.\n\nIn February 1857 Lockhart chaired a meeting against the Second Opium War; he was on the platform for a March meeting against the Opium War and Anglo-Persian War. After the watershed general election of March–April 1857, perceived to have purged from parliament radicals including John Bright, Richard Cobden and Thomas Milner Gibson, he spoke with Bronterre O'Brien at a London meeting at the Royal British Institution off City Road, chaired by Samuel Lucas. He outlined a political programme of (a) manhood suffrage, (b) more equal distribution of electors in the population, (c) no property qualification for MPs, (d) vote by ballot, and (e) triennial parliaments.\n\nIn 1862 Lockhart was in bankruptcy proceedings, as a practitioner of homoeopathy and hydropathy. At the time of his death, he was described as a familiar figure in the British Museum Reading Room.\n\nWorks\n An Apology for a Thief, or the title of 'Divine Right' a mask to cover the iniquities of the great, by a British Ismaelite (1839)\nAttica and Athens (1842), translated from Karl Otfried Müller, Georg Friedrich Grotefend and others\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Díaz del Castillo (1844), translated from the Spanish\nReport of the Fulham Charities (1846)\nThe Good Boy Henry, Or, The Young Child's Book of Manners (1849), translation from the Dutch of Nicolaas Anslijn \nThe Wife's Peril: A Romance (1867)\nThe Triple Angel, poem\n\nA volume of his correspondence with Nicolaas Beets was published in 1884.\n\nFamily\nLockhart married Emma Marie Angela Hayward in 1841.

{"topic": "Space Quest 6", "document": "Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line in 1995. It is the sixth and final game in the Space Quest series.\n\nPlot\nThe game begins with Roger Wilco being court martialed for various humorous reasons (all of which Roger, being the idiot that he is, cannot defend properly). He is demoted back to his position as second class janitor aboard the SCS DeepShip 86 (a parody of Deep Space 9). Among the reasons for Roger being simply demoted and not expelled from StarCon is the \"safe return of the SCS Eureka\". This is a continuity error in that the Eureka was in fact destroyed in Space Quest V, and it was the SCS Goliath that was safely returned.\n\nLater, on the DeepShip, Commander Kielbasa (named after the kielbasa sausage and a parody of the Kilrathi from the Wing Commander series of video games) announces that, as reward for their excellence in \"A Glitch In Time Saves Gamma Nine\" (a parody of \"a stitch in time saves nine\"), they are to be given shore leave on the planet Polysorbate LX (\"LX\" pronounced \"sixty\", after the preservative). Meanwhile, an extremely old and wrinkled woman named Sharpei (after the dog breed of the same name, also noted for its wrinkles, and voiced by Lucille Bliss) is revealed to be plotting Roger's demise. It is later revealed that she is the subject of \"Project Immortality\", which was supposed to prolong life indefinitely.\n\nRoger's adventures throughout the game have him dealing with a T-1000 like \"endodroid\" (a reference mostly to the replicants from Blade Runner, including an \"endodroid runner\" giving Roger the assignment and speaking with a New York accent), entering cyberspace (mostly a desert canyon like area, an \"office\" resembling Windows 3.1, and a seemingly endless room of file cabinets known as the \"file manager\"), and venturing into Stellar Santiago's digestive system (for which humor is added through Gary Owens' narrations providing scientific detail of everything within each area, as if from a textbook).\n\nRoger and Stellar develop a relationship that almost attracts Roger to the point of enamoration for her. This was designed as a way to potentially create another love interest for Roger. A running gag in the game is the inclusion of a rotting fish in Roger's inventory which he cannot seem to get rid of. It is revealed in an anticlimactic end that the fish is the only way to destroy Sharpei, who by the end of the game has become a virus infecting Stellar Santiago.\n\nThe game ends on a cliffhanger, with Stellar saying that Roger \"is going to like his next mission\". Despite this, Space Quest 7 never came to fruition, and the cliffhanger was never resolved.\n\nDevelopment and release\nSpace Quest 6: Roger Wilco in The Spinal Frontier ran on the later SCI32 engine Rev 2.100.002. This allowed it to use Super VGA graphics with 256 colors at 640×480 resolution. Unlike other SCI games, it did not have the interface in a pull down bar at the top of the screen, but instead used a \"verb bar\" window along the bottom of the screen, similar to LucasArts' SCUMM engine. The graphics style was also more cartoonish than in previous games, as well as incorporating an ample amount of 3-D rendered images. Gary Owens served as narrator once again.\n\nThis game was the last to be released in the Space Quest series. Having defeated the diabolical pukoid mutants in Space Quest V, Captain Roger Wilco triumphantly returns to StarCon headquarters - only to be court-martialed due to breaking StarCon regulations while saving the galaxy. The game's subtitle comes from the final portion, in which Roger has to undergo miniaturization and enter the body of a shipmate and romantic interest, a spoof of the 1987 movie Innerspace. (This segment also provided the game's original subtitle, Where in Corpsman Santiago is Roger Wilco?, which was not used due to legal threats from the makers of the Carmen Sandiego products.) The romantic interest provides a dilemma for Roger (unprecedented in the series) since she is a friend and someone other than the woman who bore Roger a son, according to the narrative in Space Quest IV.\n\nJosh Mandel designed the majority of Space Quest 6 (with Scott Murphy on board in a \"creative consultant\" capacity) but had to leave the project shortly before completion due to internal strife with Sierra. Sierra asked Scott Murphy to complete the game, and then (reportedly against Murphy's wishes) promoted SQ6 as if the former \"Guy from Andromeda\" was solely responsible for it. As an additional result of this change in designers, some puzzles—primarily in the later stages of the game—were poorly implemented due to lack of communication. In a 2006 interview, Mandel spoke candidly about his disappointment with the uneven puzzle design and implementation in the game, \"One of the inventory items cut was a comic book CD in Nigel's room that was fully readable and had all the hints to the Datacorder puzzle. From a writing and design standpoint, it was fully finished, and I know that Barry Smith had started the artwork. I don't understand why it was cut. But the comic book content was something I'd worked on for months, and it was something that I was uncharacteristically proud of ... I think it would've been one of the greatest parody sequences in the SQ series. So not only was I very upset not to see it in the game, but the fact that they had to put the Datacorder hints in the manual, leading player to think it was meant to be copy protection, disturbed me greatly.\"\n\nSierra On-Line created a special CD-ROM version of Space Quest 6s demonstration game, which was distributed with Sierra's Interaction Magazine, PC Gamer Disc 9 included with Volume 2, Issue 8 from August 1995, early pressings of Phantasmagoria, and possibly other media. This self-contained demonstration featured an alternate story not related to the main game and is fully voiced by the Space Quest 6 voice actors (early versions of the demo did not have full speech). The demo begins with Roger Wilco floating in space outside the bridge, washing the viewscreen while everyone else on the bridge is relaxing.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, an Escher cube-shaped ship approaches the Deepship 86 and beams aboard two toaster-headed mechanoids - the Bjorn (a parody of the Borg, with their cube being a parody of the Borg Cube, and named after tennis champion Björn Borg). They turn all of the crew into scoops of lemon sorbet (except Roger, who quickly ducked behind the viewscreen). Now it is up to Roger to find a way to restore his crewmates and drive off the Bjorn invaders.\n\nReception\n\nAccording to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the Space Quest series surpassed 1.2 million units by the end of March 1996.\n\nA critic for Next Generation dismissed Space Quest 6 as being essentially identical to the previous five installments of the series aside from the specific puzzles. He gave the game three out of five stars, concluding, \"If you liked the first five, you'll want this. If not, you probably aren't even reading this review.\" PC Gamer USs Gary Meredith wrote that it is \"not the best of the Space Quest series\", as it takes \"a couple of steps backwards as far as the graphics and voice-overs are concerned\". He criticized the game's narration, noting that he had disliked it in Space Quest IV as well. However, Meredith believed that Space Quest 6 would appeal to fans of the series.\n\nSpace Quest 6 tied for third place in Computer Game Reviews 1995 \"Adventure Game of the Year\" award category. The editors noted its \"good voice work\" and \"very nice animation\", and praised its humor.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1995 video games\nAdventure games\nPoint-and-click adventure games\nDOS games\nClassic Mac OS games\nParody video games\nScummVM-supported games\nSierra Entertainment games\nSingle-player video games\nSpace Quest\nWindows games\nGames commercially released with DOSBox\nVideo games developed in the United States", "instruction": " What role does the old woman named Sharpei play in the plot of Space Quest 6?"}

Initially, they performed as baskers and published their covers on YouTube. In 2017, they took part in eleventh season of the Italian talent show X Factor, where they performed such covers as \"Beggin'\" by the Four Seasons, \"Take Me Out\" by Franz Ferdinand, \"Somebody Told Me\" by the Killers and \"Let's Get It Started\" by The Black Eyed Peas. as well as their original alternative rock song \"Chosen\". Later that year, \"Chosen\" was released as the band's debut single. It, alongside covers performed in the talent show and another original song \"Recovery\", composed Måneskin's first extended play Chosen. The following year, the group released their debut album Il ballo della vita (2018), which was a funk rock and pop rock effort, containing influences of reggae and ska. The album features two prominent figures in its lyricism, a muse \"Marlena\" and a man who wants to be with her until the very end.\n\nFor their 2021 album Teatro d'ira: Vol. I, Måneskin took a direction to hard rock and glam rock genres. With the title translating to \"theatre of wrath\", the lyrics focus on venting and rebelling against anything that might have failed them. Examples of hard rock influence on the project can be heard on songs such as \"Zitti e buoni\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\", while the album also contains more dimmed tracks such as power ballad \"Vent'anni\" and \"Coraline\". Following the band's victory on Eurovision Song Contest 2021, they recorded an alternate version of \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" with American punk-rock singer Iggy Pop, while their cover of \"Beggin became widely popular. Måneskin's subsequent release was \"Mammamia\", a club-oriented dance-punk and rock \"banger\".

The match was the 47th final of the Copa América, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of CONMEBOL. The match was held at Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 10 July 2021.\n\nThe match featured two rival teams: Argentina and the tournament hosts, Brazil. Argentina won the match 1–0 to clinch their fifteenth Copa América title and first since 1993, giving captain Lionel Messi his first senior international trophy sixteen years into his career and ending a 28-year trophy drought. Argentina also equalled Uruguay's record of Copa América titles. Argentina would go on to win the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions against Italy, as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBackground\n\nArgentina and Brazil are long-time rivals, having played 107 prior matches in international competition. The two teams are among the most successful in South American football and had met in three prior Copa América finals in 1937, 2004, and 2007.\n\nIn Bangladesh, where the two teams have large fanbases, police banned outdoor gatherings in certain rural districts after clashes erupted between rival fans. In the Brahmanbaria District, a clash between fans resulted in serious injuries to four people.\n\nVenue\n\nThe 2021 Copa América was originally planned to be hosted by Argentina and Colombia, with the final scheduled for 12 July 2020 at the Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Meléndez in Barranquilla, Colombia. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that the tournament would be postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside the 2020 European Championships. Weeks before the tournament, Colombia was removed as host amid the ongoing protests in the country, while Argentina announced that they would be unable to host due to the worsening COVID-19 case rate and were replaced with Brazil despite their high death rate.\n\nFor the second consecutive time, the final was held at Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã Stadium, the largest stadium in Brazil. It was opened at 10 percent capacity, or 6,500 spectators, for the match due to COVID-19 restrictions. The stadium was excluded from hosting matches in earlier rounds of the competition due to its damaged pitch and was replaced with Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos, where players criticised the playing surface. The pitch at the Maracanã was re-laid by CONMEBOL a few days before the final.\n\nOfficials\nThe referee in charge of the match was Esteban Ostojich from Uruguay. Ostojich, along with fellow Uruguayan linesmen Carlos Barreiro and Martín Soppi, had also officiated group stage matches between Brazil and Venezuela, Peru and Colombia, and quarter final match between Peru and Paraguay. Peruvian referee Diego Haro was the fourth official having officiated in the group stage match between Bolivia and Paraguay and also as fourth official in the Argentina versus Bolivia group stage match. Uruguayan Andrés Cunha was the main video assistant referee.\n\nRoute to the final\n\nArgentina\n\nArgentina was the second-most successful nation at the Copa América with 14 victories, only one behind Uruguay's all-time total of 15 titles, but had not won since 1993. The team was seeded into Group A one of the tournament's original co-hosts and was joined by Bolivia, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, and invitees Australia until their withdrawal. Argentina had been transitioning away from its 2010s \"golden generation\" in favor of a younger core, which was reflected in manager Lionel Scaloni's call-ups for La Albiceleste. The team remained led by captain Lionel Messi, along with veterans Ángel Di María and Sergio Agüero, as the last three remaining members of the 2014 World Cup team that finished as runners-up to Germany.\n\nLa Albiceleste opened the group stage against Chile, earning a 1–1 draw. Lionel Messi scored a free kick to give Argentina the lead in the first half, but Eduardo Vargas equalised in the second half by finishing a rebound shot after a penalty taken by Arturo Vidal was saved. Argentina moved to the top of Group A by defeating Uruguay 1–0 with a header scored by Guido Rodríguez off a cross from Messi. The team secured a berth in the knockout stage on the third matchday with a 1–0 victory against Paraguay; Papu Gómez scored the lone goal of the match in the 10th minute, receiving a through ball from Di María while unmarked in the penalty area. In the final match of the group stage, against Bolivia, Argentina won 4–1 to take first place in Group A. Papu Gómez opened the scoring with a short volley from inside the penalty area in the 6th minute. Messi, who had assisted Gómez's goal, added a pair of his own with a converted penalty in the 33rd minute and chipping goalkeeper Carlos Lampe from outside the box in the 42nd minute. Bolivia earned a consolation goal in the 60th minute through Erwin Saavedra, but Argentina restored their three-goal lead with a tap-in from Lautaro Martínez five minutes later.\n\nArgentina played Ecuador, Group B's fourth-place finisher, in the quarter-finals to open the knockout stage. Messi was involved in all three of Argentina's goals in their 3–0 victory, with assists for Rodrigo De Paul in the 40th minute and Lautaro Martínez in the 84th minute before scoring a curling free kick of his own in stoppage time. The semi-final fixture against Colombia began with an early goal for Martínez in the seventh minute, but finished 1–1 in regulation time after an equaliser from Luis Díaz in the 61st minute. In the ensuing penalty shoot-out, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez saved three shots to give the team a 3–2 win after five rounds. The match featured 10 yellow cards and 47 fouls, both setting records for the Copa América.\n\nBrazil\n\nBrazil had the third-most Copa América titles, at nine, and were defending their 2019 title. The team was drawn into Group B alongside original co-hosts Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and invitees Qatar until their withdrawal. Manager Tite called up a majority of the players used in 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying for much of 2020 and 2021, led by captain Thiago Silva and star forward Neymar. Despite a rumoured boycott reported in several newspapers, the Brazil squad agreed to play in the tournament but criticised CONMEBOL for its organisation of the Copa América in the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Seleção opened their title defense with a 3–0 victory against Venezuela, who had 15 emergency call-ups to replace players who had tested positive for COVID-19. Marquinhos scored in the 23rd minute to open the match and was followed by a penalty from Neymar in the 64th minute and a chested tap-in from Gabriel Barbosa in the 89th minute. Brazil followed with a 4–0 win over Peru in their second match, including three goals in the second half, to earn an early berth in the knockout stage. Alex Sandro opened the scoring in the 12th minute and was followed by Neymar in the 68th minute, Éverton Ribeiro in the 89th minute, and Richarlison in stoppage time.\n\nColombia took an early lead against Brazil in their third match through a 10th-minute bicycle kick scored by Luis Díaz, but the Seleção earned a 2–1 comeback victory through headers from Roberto Firmino in the 78th minute and Casemiro in the tenth minute of stoppage time. Firmino's equaliser was the subject of protests from Colombia due to the ball hitting the referee earlier in the sequence, but was ruled valid by the video assistant referee.

{"topic": "Dul Johnson", "document": "Dul Johnson (born 16 September 1953) is a Nigerian filmmaker and author. He began his career as a drama director with the Nigerian Television Authority, Jos, and worked for many years before retiring into independent filmmaking and teaching. His best-known films include There is Nothing Wrong with my Uncle (a cultural documentary), The Widow’s Might (a feature film), Against the Grain, Wasting for the West, and Basket of Water.\n\nEarly life and education\nJohnson was born in 1953 in the small village of Zamlaka in the present-day Langtang North Local Government Area of Plateau State. He was born into a polygamous family, the fourth of Kongdak's 10 children. The family moved when Johnson was five years old from Zamlaka in the north to Gina in the south of Langtang, where he learned shepherding and blacksmithing. However, Johnson moved back to the north to attend primary school from 1961 to 1965. He was returned home in 1965 due to sickness, missing one academic year.\n\nWhen he returned to school in 1967, his father sent him to his maternal grandmother at the foot of the mountains at Timwat, a period of his life Johnson later described in his short story, \"Living with Shadows\".\n\nJohnson was inspired to start writing about his own life while in Form Two of secondary school, when he read The African Child by Camara Laye, who like Johnson was the son of a blacksmith, and wrote of topics he could relate to. In secondary school Johnson also began acting on the stage, participating in the production of one of Ngugi's early plays and Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice. This interest increased when he entered university, where he also began writing and directing stage plays.\n\nCareer\nIn 2010, Johnson won a writing fellowship to Brown University in the United States, where he wrote most of his first novel, Deeper into the Night. At Brown, Johnson was able to meet notable writers including George Lamming, Chinua Achebe, John Edgar Wideman, Ama Ata Aidoo and the writer and director of the INP. He also staged a small Nigerian festival as part of which he contributed his works of fiction and a film in progress.\n\nHe later took a residency at Ebedi in Oyo State, Nigeria, visited Goa for the International Film Festival of India in 2012, and went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2013 where his film There is Nothing Wrong with my Uncle was in a festival.\n\nWorks\nJohnson has published five major works: Shadows and Ashes, Why Women Won't make it to Heaven (short story collections), Ugba Uye: The Living Legend (a biography), Deeper into the Night (a novel) and Melancholia (a play). The last two were presented to the public on 28 October 2014.\n\nAs well as writing plays, Johnson has also produced poetry, journalistic writing and short stories. In the 1970s he wrote plays for radio (Rima Radio, Sokoto) and for the stage, some of which were produced while he was an undergraduate. One of his productions received such a scathing review from one of his lecturers that he hid himself in his room for two days and refused to attend the lecturer's classes for a week. None of his early plays from this period survive. As a student, Johnson also wrote for the campus gossip magazine known as The Spark, working as a production manager.\n\nLegacy and honours\nWhile working with the NTA, Johnson won several awards with his TV dramas.

{"topic": "Mirror Dance", "document": "Mirror Dance is a Hugo- and Locus-award-winning science fiction novel by Lois McMaster Bujold. Part of the Vorkosigan Saga, it was first published by Baen Books in March 1994, and is included in the 2002 omnibus Miles Errant.\n\nPlot summary \nMark, Miles Vorkosigan's clone, masquerades as him and dupes his mercenary force, the Dendarii, into undertaking a mission to free about 50 clones on Jackson's Whole, an anything-goes freebooters' planet where Mark was created and raised. These teenage clones are scheduled to have their brains replaced by those of their wealthy, aged progenitors. When Miles finds out, he attempts to rescue his troops and his brother from the mess Mark has made, but is killed by a needle grenade. He is frozen in a cryonic chamber on the spot, but the medic in charge becomes separated from the rest of the men while retreating under fire. The medic uses an automated shipping system to send the chamber to safety, but is killed before he can tell anyone what he did and where he sent it.\n\nThe Dendarii flee the debacle and take Mark to Miles' parents on Barrayar. Cordelia accepts him as another son and has him acknowledged legally as a member of the family. After a while, Mark becomes frustrated by Barrayaran Imperial Security's lack of progress; he is convinced that Miles is still on Jackson's Whole, and decides to go there himself. Cordelia helps by buying him a starship. He invites some of the Dendarii along, including Captain Quinn, Miles' second-in-command and lover.\n\nMeanwhile, Miles has been secretly received and resuscitated by the Duronas, a research group cloned from a medical genius and employed by Jackson's Whole magnate Baron Fell. They hope they have Miles (rather than Mark) under their care, but he is suffering from normal, hopefully temporary, post-revival amnesia, so they are unsure. The Duronas wish to hire the Dendarii, who are known for pulling off difficult extractions, to help them escape from Jackson's Whole. Miles' memory takes some time to return. \n\nMark finds Miles, but is captured by Miles' old nemesis, Baron Ryoval, and tortured for five days. His personality fragments into four sub-personalities: Gorge the glutton, Grunt the sex pervert, Howl the masochist, and Killer the assassin. Together, the first three protect Mark's fragile persona, while Killer bides his time. When Ryoval's assistant informs him that Mark seems to have adjusted remarkably quickly and is actually enjoying the torture, a frustrated Ryoval decides to study his victim alone. Killer takes the opportunity to kill Ryoval, enabling Mark to escape. Mark sells Ryoval's security access codes to Baron Fell for a large sum of money and the Durona Group's freedom.\n\nMiles' short death and revivification have serious repercussions for his health. Mark has his own problems, thanks to his strange upbringing, complicated by the torture. When he asks his mother for help, she sends him to Beta Colony for psychiatric treatment and therapy.\n\nBy necessity, this novel is told from the viewpoints of Miles and Mark. This was the first novel in the Vorkosigan series to be written this way, though not the first time Bujold has employed this style; the first occasion was in Falling Free.\n\nAwards\nMirror Dance won both the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1995.\n\nReferences \n\n1994 American novels\n1994 science fiction novels\nAmerican science fiction novels\nHugo Award for Best Novel-winning works\nNovels by Lois McMaster Bujold\nVorkosigan Saga\nFiction about suspended animation", "instruction": " What role does Baron Fell play in helping the Duronas escape from Jackson's Whole?"}

{"topic": "Vivian Stanshall", "document": "Vivian Stanshall (born Victor Anthony Stanshall; 21 March 1943 – 5 March 1995) was an English singer-songwriter, musician, author, poet and wit, best known for his work with the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, for his exploration of the British upper classes in Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (as a radio series for John Peel, as an audio recording, as a book and as a film), and for acting as Master of Ceremonies on Mike Oldfield's album Tubular Bells.\n\nEarly life and education\nStanshall was born on 21 March 1943 at the Radcliffe Maternity Home Shillingford, Oxfordshire, son of Victor George Stanshall (1909–1990; born Vivian), at the time of his son's birth an RAF corporal, later a company secretary, then company director (FCIS), and Eileen Monica Prudence (née Wadeson). He was christened Victor Anthony. He lived with his mother while his father served in the RAF during the Second World War. Stanshall described this early period as the happiest time of his childhood.\n\nWhen the war ended his father returned, but the young Victor found him difficult and comparatively stern after having been alone with his mother. His father made him speak with a \"plummy\" accent for which he later became known. The family moved to the father's hometown of Walthamstow, Essex, where Stanshall's younger brother Mark was born in 1949. With six years between them, the brothers were never close. \n\nStanshall studied at Walthamstow College of Art, where he met fellow students Ian Dury and Peter Greenaway.\n\nWhen he was 10, the Stanshall family moved to the Essex coastal town of Leigh-on-Sea. He attended Southend High School for Boys until 1959. As a young man, Stanshall (known as Vic) earned money doing various odd jobs at the Kursaal fun fair in nearby Southend-on-Sea. These included working as a bingo caller and spending the winter painting the fairground attractions. To set aside enough money to get through art school (his father having refused to fund this), Stanshall spent a year in the Merchant Navy. He said he was a very bad waiter, but became a great teller of tall tales.\n\nStanshall enrolled at the Central School of Art and Design in London. He joined fellow students in forming a band (including Rodney Slater, Roger Ruskin Spear and Neil Innes, who was studying art at Goldsmiths College). Innes said of their first meeting: \"We first met in a big Irish pub in South London, the New Cross Arms ... he was quite plump in those days, and he was wearing Billy Bunter check trousers, a Victorian frock coat, black coat tails, horrible little oval, violet-tinted pince-nez glasses, he had a euphonium under his arm, and large rubber false ears. And I thought, well, this is an interesting character.\" At about this time, Stanshall changed his first name to 'Vivian', the name his father had abandoned. This was not made his legal name until 1977. Those who knew him from his student days continued to call him 'Vic'. Later friends and collaborators knew him as 'Viv'.\n\nBonzo years \n\nThe Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band were named after a word game that Stanshall played with co-founder Slater, in which they cut up sentences and juxtaposed fragments to form new ones. 'Bonzo Dog/Dada' was one result which they liked. The band initially performed under this name, but grew tired of explaining what Dada meant; hence they changed it to the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, 'doo-dah' being a quaint expression that both Slater's mother and Stanshall himself used to describe everyday objects. Later this name was shortened to The Bonzo Dog Band, or just The Bonzos.\n\nMuch of the band's original repertoire was based on comedic re-workings of songs from the 1920s and 1930s, found on 78 records, bought for pennies from local flea markets.\n\nFor a while the band operated semi-professionally, playing local pubs and the college circuit. After acquiring a manager, they went full-time and were booked on the working men's club circuit, mainly in the north of England. The band dominated their lives, as they frequently travelled to low-paying gigs in an old van crammed with any number of musical instruments, an assortment of props, and prop robots. In 1967, they appeared in the Beatles' television film Magical Mystery Tour, in which they played Stanshall's \"Death Cab for Cutie\" during the strip club scene. The appearance led to a spot as the house band on Do Not Adjust Your Set, a weekly children's television revue series that was also notable for early appearances by half of what became the Monty Python team.\n\nAccording to their manager/agent Gerry Bron, after a perhaps ill-advised agreement that the band should be left to their own artistic devices, Stanshall was allowed several weeks in a hired rehearsal space to write songs for the new Bonzo Dog Band album. When Bron arrived at the location to check the progress of these endeavours, he found that Stanshall had not written anything at all and had instead built a variety of hutches for his pet rabbits. Bron mentioned in a television documentary that this occurred in May 1968 in a hall in Acton, west London; the actual location is Askew Road Church Hall, at the start of Bassein Park Road in Shepherd's Bush. The date would suggest that these were rehearsals for the album The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse. During recordings for the album proper at Morgan Studios, Stanshall, wearing just a rabbit's head and underpants, interviewed members of the public in Willesden High Road. On the album track \"We Are Normal\", one interviewee can be heard to remark, 'He's got a head on him like a rabbit.'\n\nLater in 1968, the Bonzos scored a surprise top-ten hit with \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\" co-produced by Paul McCartney and Gus Dudgeon under the alias 'Apollo C. Vermouth'. Meanwhile the band toured incessantly and recorded a multitude of radio sessions for the BBC, alongside several albums. They also embarked upon two poorly organised but well-received tours of the United States. (Neil Innes remembers that the band were stopped by a local sheriff and asked if they were carrying any firearms or drugs. When they denied both, the officer asked how they were going to defend themselves. Stanshall piped up from the back of the minibus, \"With good manners!\") It was during the particularly disastrously organised second tour that the Bonzos decided to break up, partly because of Stanshall's growing stage fright – combined with his increasing use of valium to help combat this – but also because of anger with their management, after Spear's wife suffered a miscarriage while he was away, and no-one informed him. The band subsequently decided to split whilst they were still friends. They played their last show in March 1970, at Loughborough University.\n\nAfter the Bonzos\nStanshall formed a number of short-lived groups during 1970 alone, including biG GRunt (formed while the Bonzos were still on their farewell tour, and including fellow Bonzos Roger Ruskin Spear and Dennis Cowan, and with Anthony 'Bubs' White on guitar), The Sean Head Showband (again featuring Cowan and White), Gargantuan Chums, and the slightly longer-lived Bonzo Dog Freaks, with Innes and the ever-faithful Cowan and White (this conglomerate was also known simply as 'Freaks'). Early that year, biG GRunt recorded a well-received session for BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, and shortly afterwards made a memorable appearance on BBC television. Despite this promising start, biG GRunt dissolved during their first UK tour when Stanshall became incapacitated by the onset of an anxiety disorder that caused a nervous breakdown and would continue to plague him for the rest of his life.\n\nHowever, he soon recovered sufficiently to record and release, on the Liberty label, his first solo single \"Labio-Dental Fricative/Paper Round\", credited to Vivian Stanshall and The Sean Head Showband (an oblique reference", "instruction": " What significant musical projects did Vivian Stanshall pursue after the disbanding of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band besides his brief stints with various short-lived bands?"}
{"topic": "Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria", "document": "The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, formerly known as the Federated Coast Miwok, is a federally recognized American Indian tribe of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo Indians. The tribe was officially restored to federal recognition in 2000 by the U.S. government pursuant to the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act.\n\nEarly history\n\nPrior to European contact, the residents of Marin and Sonoma Counties were bands of Native Californians belonging to two linguistic and cultural groups: the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo, living in close proximity to each other and indigenous to Marin and southern Sonoma Counties in Northern California. Occupied at various times during more than thirty centuries, over 600 village sites have been identified in the Coast Miwok territory, stretching from Bodega Bay to the north, eastward beyond the towns of Cotati and Sonoma, and along the Point Reyes National Seashore and the shores of Tomales Bay. \n\nThe year 1579 was the earliest recorded account made by the Europeans of the Coast Miwok people on the coast of Marin in the Point Reyes area, as documented in a diary by Chaplain Fletcher who was aboard Sir Francis Drake's ship. In 1595, The Coast Miwok came into contact with the crew of the San Agustin, a Manila Galleon, captained by Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho and crewed by Filipino mariners. During the Mission Period of 1779–1823, Mission San Francisco de Asís (also called \"Mission Dolores\"), Mission San Rafael Arcángel and Mission San Francisco Solano used Indians, including the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people, as a key source of labor.\n\nAs early as 1830, a Filipino named Domingo Felix married a Coast Miwok woman named Euphrasia Valencia, and they started a family who later settled in Lairds Landing in 1861. The family who descended from this multiracial couple remained there until 1955. Some of the Coast Miwok trace their lineage to this couple.\n\nThe territorial lands of the Southern Pomo are in Sonoma County, south of the Russian River to the southern Santa Rosa area. The Southern Pomo were the first inhabitants of what is now the town of Sebastopol, with several smaller traditional Southern Pomo villages located southeast of Sebastopol along the Laguna de Santa Rosa. California anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber stated:\n\nBatiklechawi, at Sebastapol at the head of the slough known as Laguna de Santa Rosa, was an important town, and therefore presumably the headquarters of a division [of the Southern Pomo]. Another group tentatively may be inferred as having occupied the bulk of the shores of the laguna.\n\nRecent history\nMost of the Coast Miwok continued to live in their traditional lands through the 20th century. They worked in sawmills, as agricultural laborers, and fished to supplement their incomes.\n\nThe Graton Rancheria was a  Indian rancheria near Sebastopol in Sonoma County. The rancheria was established for Coast Miwok, Southern Pomo, and other Indians living in the region. In 1920, when Indians began to settle the land, they discovered that all but  were inhospitable.\n\nThe US government terminated the trust agreement (federal recognition) of the Graton Rancheria in 1958. Gloria Armstrong (Miwok) privately owned a  lot of the previous rancheria. In 1992, the tribe initiated the procedure to regain federal recognition. Recognition was achieved on December 27, 2000 through the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act passed by the U.S. Congress. On April 18, 2008, the tribe acquired  of land.\n\nSince 2007, the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria has collaborated with Occidental Arts and Ecology in Occidental, California to create workshops called Tradition Environmental Knowledge on organic farming, herbology, native plant restoration, and ethnobotany.\n\nGovernment\nThe tribe has approximately 1,438 members (1,438 as of October 1, 2019). The tribe's government offices are located in Rohnert Park, California. Tribal governmental programs and services include sacred sites preservation and protection, Indian housing, Indian education, membership, cultural arts, social services, and tribal health.\n\nThe Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria are governed by a seven-member Tribal Council who are elected to two-year terms by the adult tribal membership.

It is known as the South American black widow, Brazilian black widow or Araña del trigo.\n\nDescription \nLike many black widow species, females are larger than males, growing up to 11–17 mm, with their body and legs black and red. Males are much smaller, known by their long legs, and white or brown color. Latrodectus curacaviensis is mainly nocturnal. It is not aggressive to humans, but females will attack to defend their egg sacs. It feeds on small insects. They have a distinct hourglass mark with a black diamond shape and four red triangles in a square. Bites are rare but dangerous.\n\nDistribution and habitat \nIt has been reported in the Lesser Antilles and South America. It is usually found under logs, in sheds, stone fireplaces, near trash and debris.\n\nVenom \nThe venom contains excitatory neurotoxins (alpha-latrotoxins). Bites usually deliver only small amounts of venom, which may result in dangerous symptoms mostly in children, old people and people with cardiovascular and respiratory problems. Reported symptoms include intense local pain. Systemic symptoms include sweating, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, eyelids swelling, salivation, rigid and painful abdominal muscles, nausea, vomits and impaired sight. In a case that occurred in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, other symptoms were reported, such as muscle spasms, fever, chills and intense sweating – common symptoms of latrodectism, There are some reports of priapism.

She was one of Sweden's first rock musicians during the 1950s. She won her stage name via a bet with another singer who used the same name. She was a founding member of two bands, Trio med Olga and Hafvsbandet.\n\nCareer\nAt the beginning of her career, in 1958, she was working as a warden at Ulleråkers sjukhus, a mental institution and hospital, where she used to play her guitar during breaks to entertain her colleagues. Her friends entered her in a talent competition called Ungdom med ton (English: Youth with tones). Rock-Olga performed a cover of the 1957 Micki Marlo–Paul Anka duet \"What You've Done to Me\" and won the competition. The song also became her first hit and made her one of the first rock stars in Sweden. At the time, another singer known as Stockholms-Olga also used the stage name Rock-Olga. The two artists made a bet with each other, that whichever of them won a significant song competition would also have exclusive right to the stage name.\n\nAfter winning the song competition, Jacobsson travelled to Stockholm with her father, hoping to perform at the popular Nalens dance hall. She would later recall her father talking with the manager of Nalens, Topsy Lindblom, who first stated that \"lots of daughters can sing\", but then relented and asked her to come in when Jacobsson's father stated \"Yes but she can sing rock\". Her first performance at Nalens caused the resident rock band members to leave their dressing rooms to watch the performance, something that had never happened before. Her solo career peaked in the early part of the 1960s. In 1968, she started her own danceband called Trio med Olga (\"Trio with Olga\").\n\nDuring the 1970s and the 1980s, she was one of the founding members of the rock and gammaldans band Hafvsbandet along with her husband Lars-Christer Magnusson and others. Both prior to and after her time in Hafvsbandet, Rock-Olga performed with another rock band called Rockfolket (\"The Rock People\").\n\nIn 1972, she recorded an album called Rock Olga Today with three members of the fledgling, soon-to-be-named pop group ABBA: Benny Andersson on piano, Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad as backing vocals. She also participated in Allsång på Skansen (Sing-along at Skansen), which was broadcast on Sveriges Television in 2008. In later years, she still travelled across Sweden performing as many as 30 concerts per year, usually at retirement homes where \"What You've Done to Me\" was always part of her set.\n\nDeath\nRock-Olga developed a fever after performing at Gröna Lund on 8 May 2010, and was subsequently diagnosed with blood poisoning from a cut on her toe.

{"topic": "Audley Dean Nicols", "document": "Audley Dean Nicols (22 September 1875–13 November 1941) was an American artist, illustrator and muralist. Born and raised in Sewickley, Pennsylvania; he studied in New York and Europe, and worked as an illustrator for various national magazines in the United States. He moved to El Paso, Texas in the early 1920s, where he painted desert landscapes of the American Southwest. Nicols achieved national recognition during his lifetime; his style and choice of subjects gathering followers who became known as the \"Purple Mountain Painters\".\n\nLife and career \nBorn in 1875 in Sewickley  from Pittsburgh along the Ohio River, Audley Dean Nicols was the son of Parshall D. Nicols, an iron broker, and Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Agnes McLaughlin, an art teacher. He had a sister, Alice Clyde Nicols, and two brothers, Verner, who died of the Spanish Flu, and Lowell, who was an art critic and an optical glass research chemist. His mother Lizzie, who had studied with painter George Hetzel and taught drawing and painting at the Steubenville Seminary, gave him his first art lessons.\n\nAfter graduating from Sewickley High School in 1893 he went to New York to study under Harry Siddons Mowbray, Edwin Blashfield, and Kenyon Cox, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Art Students League of New York. After further studies in Europe, Nicols started a career as a magazine illustrator, working for several publications including Collier's, McClure's, Cosmopolitan, Harper's, Scribner's, St. Nicholas Magazine, and The Burr McIntosh Monthly. After a period of convalescence at home due to surgical operations, he moved into oil painting, working from a studio in the Sewickley Valley Trust building. Some of his work from this earlier period includes murals in Pittsburgh public buildings and portraits. He painted Civil War General Alexander Hays in a portrait and in a now lost painting where he is shown dragging the Confederate flag from his horse. His work in oils began to get some recognition and in 1904 Nicols' painting A Reverie was accepted for the ninth Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh.\n\nNicols began visiting the Arizona desert and Texas from around 1912, permanently moving with his family to El Paso in 1922, due in part to health problems with an extrapulmonary tuberculosis contracted in his youth, and that made him walk with a limp.  He lived in a rock house in Fort Boulevard at the foothills of the Franklin mountains, and since before his permanent move he went on long desert expeditions for plein air painting, first in the company of two Franciscan priests and later with a friend. His first work with of a desert subject was bought by breakfast cereal pioneer Charles W. Post in a Chicago gallery, sometime between 1912 and 1914.Nicols continued to paint desert panoramas of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California, and large canvas on Old West subjects. His 1927 depiction of Tokay, a former coal-mining settlement in Socorro County, New Mexico, is considered a valuable historical record of what is now a ghost town. Also in 1927, a lithograph reproduction of Nicols' painting of Texas' El Capitan peak was distributed in a publicity campaign for the Texas and Pacific Railway. The original painting of the mountain was later placed in Abilene's Research Center for the Southwest, at the Hardin-Simmons University library. In 1929 he was commissioned by architect Henry Trost to design the glass-stained mural which incorporates the  painting Cave creek canyon - Chiricahua mountains, located at the top of the lobby stairs of the Gadsden Hotel in Douglas, Arizona.\n\nIn his later life Nicols was characterized as eccentric and mysterious, absorbed by his work, but he had a circle of close friends including other artists and General Robert L. Howze. He was married to Mary Olivia Nicols , an Irish immigrant, and had two children, Audley Dean Jr and Mary Beth. In 1932 he was hospitalized for several weeks due to a brain hemorrhage but eventually recovered. He died almost ten years later in November 1941, just a few months after celebrating his daughter's 10th birthday. The artist was buried in Restlawn Memorial Park in El Paso, with writer and muralist Tom Lea, who was also Mary Beth's godfather, acting as one of the pallbearers.\n\nStyle and legacy \nAudley Dean Nicols' style of clean, detailed landscape painting was inspired by the clarity, sharp lines and strong contrasts of the desert, and he applied techniques to capture the colors and hint at the vast expanses. Nicols said in 1916:The desert is everything but gray. There are clean fresh blues, pinks and yellows in the skies, opalescent purple, rose and lavender in the ever-present distant mountains, dull greens of every shade in the vegetation, reds and yellows in the rocks and earth -but never gray.Critics have recognized his depiction of the distinctive nature of desert light as one of the best. Nicols' compositions are often organized in three horizontal sections; the desert ground and vegetation below, mountains in the middle and the sky above. He depicted vibrant nature scenes with only small traces of humans, if any, using warm light and vivid colors such as bluish purple for the distant mountains. The style and subjects of his work achieved significant popularity and were followed by other West Texas artists, who collectively became known as the \"Purple Mountain Painters\". Nicols was a friend of other local El Paso artists such as Fremont Ellis and Lewis Teel, and encouraged Eugene Thurston to start painting.\n\nNicols is considered an important early Texas artist who is especially known for his large-scale portrayals of desert scenes, although he mostly depicted human subjects in his earlier work, and got an honorable mention in the 1927 San Antonio wild flower competition organized by oilman and philanthropist Edgar B. Davis. Nicols' work View of El Paso at sunset was included in the 2019 major exhibition \"The Art of Texas: 250 Years\" at the Witte Museum, San Antonio. This  painting was commissioned by the First National Bank of El Paso in 1925; when the bank closed in 1933, a local resident purchased it and donated it to El Paso High School. The painting remained on display at the school library until 1972, when it was taken down for restoration. During renovations of the school in 2000, the painting was discovered in a janitor's closet.\n\nNicols achieved some national recognition during his lifetime, his well-sold paintings helping to romanticize the Southwest and forming part of several private and public collections, including that of the White House during the Warren G. Harding administration (1921–1923). Records show that  paintings by Nicols sold at between $250 and $500 by the end of the 1920s, which were considerable sums at the time. Results from Heritage Auctions for sales done between 2005 and 2019 show prices ranging from $4,000 to $22,500. In a 2017 Bonhams auction, Desert at dusk (1928) with dimensions of  sold for $35,000. , works by Nicols are part of the permanent collections of museums such as the Phoenix Art Museum, Tucson Museum of Art, and El Paso Museum of Art.\n\nPaintings\n\nFurther reading\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1875 births\n1941 deaths\nPainters from Pittsburgh\nAmerican male painters\nArt Students League of New York alumni\nPeople associated with the Metropolitan Museum of Art\nAmerican magazine illustrators", "instruction": " What significant exhibitions or shows did Audley Dean Nicols participate in outside of Pittsburg and the Carnegie International Exhibition?"}

She was a founding member of the 1980s rock band Do-Ré-Mi with their top-5 hit \"Man Overboard\".\n\nConway performs solo and has a top-20 hit single with \"It's Only the Beginning\" (1991). The associated album, String of Pearls, also peaked in the top 20. She won the ARIA Award for Best Female Artist at the 1992 awards. Her next album, Bitch Epic, reached the top 20 in November 1993. Conway organised and performed on the Broad Festivals from 2005 to 2008—show-casing contemporary Australian female artists.\n\nCareer\n\n1959–1980: Early years and The Benders\nDeborah Ann Conway was born on 8 August 1959 in Melbourne, Victoria. Her father was a lawyer in Toorak and Conway attended Lauriston Girls' School—photos of her as a schoolgirl were displayed at the Sydney Jewish Museum. Later she went to University of Melbourne—modelling and singing her way through. A billboard campaign for Bluegrass jeans featured Conway's nude backside and the phrase \"Get yours into Bluegrass\". Other ads with Conway as a model include Big M and Crunchie.\n\nAt the age of 18, Conway started playing guitar, and in 1980 she joined The Benders as a vocalist whilst still at university. Her father was so concerned when she joined the pop band that he sent her to a psychiatrist. Other members of The Benders included Neville Aresca (bass guitar), Les Barker (guitars, vocals), Dorland Bray (drums, vocals), John Campbell, Daniel Solowiej and Greg Thomas (guitar, keyboards). They performed mostly in Melbourne pubs playing original material—mostly written by Conway and Thomas—and Blondie and Devo covers. Conway also wrote songs with Bray.\n\nConway had minor roles in Mallacoota Stampede (1979) and Hard Knocks (1980).\n\n1981–1991: Do-Ré-Mi to Rose Amongst Thorns\nIn 1981, Deborah Conway and Bray relocated to Sydney and formed pop rockers Do-Ré-Mi with Helen Carter on bass guitar and Stephen Philip on guitar. They recorded two albums, Domestic Harmony (1985) and The Happiest Place in Town (1988), and eight singles. Their best performed hit, \"Man Overboard\", peaked at No. 5 on the Australia Kent Music Report Singles Chart and became the eighth-highest-positioned Australian song on the 1985 End of Year Chart. In the early 1980s, Conway was the domestic partner of Paul Hester—drummer for Deckchairs Overboard and then Split Enz—before he left for Los Angeles in 1985 and formed Crowded House there.\n\nDeborah Conway played the lead role of \"Julie\" in an Australian teenage road movie called Running on Empty, which was released in 1982.\n\nIn late 1983, Conway supplied vocals for actor Tracy Mann's singing in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV series Sweet and Sour (1984) including the hit title song, \"Sweet and Sour\". Two soundtrack albums and three singles from the series were credited to The Takeaways (and Various Artists). Conway sang lead vocals on half the songs and backing vocals on almost all the rest. Conway had a minor role in The Coca-Cola Kid (1985).\n\nIn 1986 Conway performed with The Rock Party, a charity project initiated by The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which included many Australasian musicians: Neil Finn, Eddie Rayner, Tim Finn, Nick Seymour and Hester (all from Crowded House); Geoff Stapleton, Robbie James and Mark Callaghan (all from GANGgajang); Reg Mombassa and Martin Plaza (both from Mental As Anything); Andrew Barnum and Lissa Barnum (Vitabeats); Mary Azzopardi (Rockmelons), Michael Barclay, Peter Blakeley, Jenny Morris, Danny De Costa, Greg Herbert (The Promise), Spencer P Jones, Sean Kelly (Models), John Kennedy, Paul Kelly, Robert Susz (Dynamic Hepnotics) and Rick Swinn (The Venetians). The Rock Party released a 12\" single \"Everything to Live For\", which was produced by Joe Wissert, Phil Rigger and Phil Beazley.\n\nDo-Ré-Mi disbanded in 1988 not long after their second album was released. Rolling Stone (Australia) named Conway 'Best Australian Female Singer' for that year.\n\nWhile Do-Ré-Mi were working in England in 1988, Conway became involved in Pete Townshend's project The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend. Shortly afterwards she recorded an album of dance music in Los Angeles which was not released except for a solo single, a cover of Bad Company's \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" (1990), produced by Scott Cutler.\n\nIn 1990, Conway formed Drawcards as a semi-acoustic band with Vika and Linda, Stephen Cummings, Dror Erez, Tim Finn, Ross Hannaford, Peter Jones, Shane O'Mara and Chris Wilson. Almost immediately it split with half its members—Conway, Hester, Erez, Jones and Wilson—forming Rose Amongst Thorns as a pub rock band from 1990 to 1991.\n\n1991–1996: String of Pearls & Bitch Epic\n\nIn 1991, Conway played Juno in Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books, singing a setting of William Shakespeare's masque from The Tempest to music by Michael Nyman.\n\nDeborah Conway's debut solo album was released in October 1991, titled String of Pearls, which peaked at No. 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The album was produced by Richard Pleasance, Joe Hardy and Michael den Elzen. Singles from the album include \"It's Only the Beginning\" which reached No. 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart in August, \"Under My Skin\" (December) and \"Release Me\" (February 1992), all three of which were co-written with Scott Cutler. For her work on the album, she won ARIA Award for Best Female Artist at the ARIA Music Awards of 1992. To support the releases, Deborah Conway and the Mothers of Pearl was formed with Alan Harding (keyboards), Peter Jones (drums, ex-Drawcards and Rose Amongst Thorns), Bill McDonald (bass guitar) and Willy Zygier (guitar). Conway and Zygier became domestic partners and have written and performed much of Conway's subsequent material.\n\nConway released her second album Bitch Epic in 1993, which peaked at No. 18 and was produced by Jim Rondinelli and Zygier. The cover features an upper body shot of a topless Conway, covered in Nutella (a hazelnut spread) and cream, as she is about to eat a slice of cake thereby illustrating the concept of Gluttony (see album cover at right) for ABC TV mini-series Seven Deadly Sins (1993). Conway, Paul Kelly, Vika Bull and Renée Geyer provided vocals and song writing for the related soundtrack. An eight-track extended play of live songs was added to Bitch Epic to form 1994's Epic Theatre, which was produced by Zygier. Her backing band were Zygier, Harding, McDonald and Hughie Benjamin (ex-Yothu Yindi) on drums.\n\nUltrasound, an experimental band, with Conway, Zygier, McDonald and Hester, recorded and produced their self-titled album, Ultrasound (1995). At the end of the year, Conway and Zygier relocated to England with their newborn daughter.\n\nIn 1996, a portrait of Conway as Medusa, painted by Rosemary Valadon, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize.

Both larvae and adults are known to feed on Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max. Adults appeared in the fields in March, when the plants are small. Adult female lays eggs by the end of March or early April. Highest infestation occurs during April to June. It produces 3 to 4 generations per year. The duration of the egg stage is about 6 and larval stage from first instar to fourth instar lasted for 13 days. The prepupal duration is about 2 days and the pupal stage is about 6 days.\n\nThe mating lasted from 5 to 60 minutes. The preoviposition period is about 8 to 17 days. During oviposition, female lays eggs singly, or up to ten eggs together, on the leaf surface or in tendrils of host plants. Eggs are flat on host leaves, or sometimes attached to or inserted into tendrils. Initial color of the eggs is light yellow, but gradually changes to gray before hatching.\n\nLarva soft bodied, moderately elongated to oval.

{"topic": "Gille de Vlieg", "document": "Gille de Vlieg (born 26 July 1940) is a photographer and anti-apartheid activist. She was born in England and moved to South Africa with her mother when she was 3 years old. During apartheid she was a member of both the Black Sash and one of the few women members of the Afrapix photography collective. Her images have been published in newspapers, magazines and books nationally and internationally. Unlike many of her counterparts, de Vlieg received little public acclaim for her work up until recently. About her work, she says, \"I wanted to make a contribution to an alternative view of South Africa, a view not seen on the South African TV screen then.\" Her images cover the following topics: land removals, rural lifestyle, township lifestyle, gender lifestyle, United Democratic Front (UDF), anti-harassment campaign, police violence, protests against death penalty, funerals, Black Sash, protests against incorporation into Bophuthatswana; Release Mandela Campaign, End Conscription Campaign (ECC), conscientious objectors, African National Congress (ANC) Welcome Home Rally, Day of the Vow (Geloftedag), street children, and homeless people.\n\nLife\nGille de Vlieg was born Gillian Ruth Hemson in Plymouth, England in 1940 during a Nazi bombing raid on the city. After losing their home in a later bombing raid, she and her mother relocated to Durban, South Africa in February 1944.  Her father had been sent by the Admiralty (Royal Navy) to work on radar installations at the Simon's Town Naval Base and later on Salisbury Island, Durban.\n\nIn 1958, de Vlieg was trained as a nurse at Greys Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. After finishing her diploma, she worked in London and met her first husband, Iain Paton Millar, a journalist. After a short period in Katanga Province of the DRC she moved to Johannesburg in 1963, where her daughters Ruth and Katherine were born.  Katherine died when nine months old and her marriage to Iain disintegrated just prior to the birth of her son, Andrew.  She lived for a time in Botha's Hill and Durban where she met and married Rob de Vlieg, a sail maker.  They moved back to Johannesburg to set up his business in 1975.  It was not until 1982 that she joined the Johannesburg Black Sash as a volunteer and she was soon put onto their regional committee and became a vice-chairperson.  It was during the height of student riots in Tembisa in 1984 that Gille de Vlieg first made contact with Greg Thulare, an organiser for COSAS in Tembisa. She was slowly introduced to the politics of the UDF and ANC during this time. One of her responsibilities at Black Sash was to work with rural communities which were threatened with removal to the homelands, and she soon became interested in taking photos. When Paul Weinberg asked her to join Afrapix, she replied, \"Okay, I will come to work for Afrapix, but I'm not working as a secretary, I want to be a photographer.\" She had a camera and a couple of lenses but knew very little about photography. Paul Weinberg taught her how to process the film and Cedric Nunn taught her how to print. She quickly realised she could use photography as a means of protest. The next several years she spent documenting various townships and rural areas mostly in the former Transvaal. As it was then illegal for a white woman to enter the black townships, she lied to get a permit from the Tembisa Council and eventually was allowed into Tembisa under the guise of taking pictures for Anglo American. While working in Tembisa, she met other members of COSAS including Debra Marakalala, Sipho (Sandile) Qwabe, Tshepo Mphuti and Reuben Mahlagare. Trust developed between them and de Vlieg. Her house in the safe northern suburbs of Johannesburg was often used as a hideout when the police were looking for COSAS activists. In June 1986, de Vlieg was arrested after a raid on her house, initially under Section 50 of the Internal Security Act, and taken to John Vorster Square and then to the Hillbrow police station for thirty-seven days. De Vlieg now lives on the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.\n\nPhotography\nGille de Vlieg was an activist before she was a photographer, coming to photography through her work with the Black Sash. Many of her images formed part of the Afrapix monthly packages sent to various European organisations to support the fight against Apartheid. The Gille de Vlieg photographic collection is included in the on-line South African History Archive and contains 581 black and white digital images. She is also one of two women featured in Beyond the Barricades.  In 2014 she was nominated as a finalist of the Mbokodo Awards.\n\nCollective exhibitions\n2012 – Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and the Bureaucracy of Everyday Life – International Centre of Photography, New York City, NY\n2012 – NUMSA\n2011 – Photography 1950 – 2010 – Pretoria Art Museum, Pretoria\n2009 – End Conscription Campaign (ECC)\n2002 – Shooting Resistance: South African Photography 1976 – 1994 – Axis Gallery Inc., New York City, NY\n1990 – Malibongwe – Netherlands\n1989 – Radda Barnen – Sweden\n1987 – Taking Sides in South America – TPW – Toronto Photographers Workshop, Toronto, ON\n1985 – People's Portraits – South African National Gallery\n\nIndividual shows\n2012 – 'Hidden from View: Community Carers and HIV in Rural South Africa' held at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, produced in co-operation with Amnesty International\n2009 – 'Rising Up Together' at Durban Art Gallery premiering at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown\n2006 – 'Rising Up' at Constitution Hill, Johannesburg, opened by former Constitutional Court judge, Kate O'Regan\n\nPublications\nVukhani Makhozikazi (1985)\nBeyond the Barricades (1989)\nWomen by Women: '50 Years of Women's Photography in South Africa' (2006)\n\nReferences\n\n1940 births\nLiving people\nSouth African photographers\nBlack Sash", "instruction": " What significant events occurred in Gille de Vlieg's life after her release from detention in 1986?"}
{"topic": "Injection port", "document": "An injection port is a medical device used for the administration of insulin or other physician approved medicine into the subcutaneous tissue (the tissue layer just below the skin).  The device is similar to infusion sets used by insulin pumps, except it is configured to receive a syringe instead of a tubing system. An injection port is usually a disposable device applied by the patient and worn for period of 3–5 days.  When giving shots via an injection port, the needle stays above the surface of the skin.  Medication is delivered via a short soft cannula. An injection port can be used in conjunction with multiple daily injections of insulin by people with diabetes.  It can also be used for the subcutaneous administration of any other physician prescribed medication.\n\nApplying, wearing and using\nInjection ports are usually applied by the patient.  The device comes with a needle surrounded by a soft cannula.  The needle and cannula are manually inserted into the patient's tissue.  Immediately after insertion the needle is removed and the cannula remains below the surface of the skin.\n\nPorts are usually worn on the abdomen, but can also be worn on other areas such as the buttocks, thigh or arm.  Typical injection ports are worn for 3 days and then replaced with another port.\n\nInsulin is injected via a syringe into the injection port.  Medication immediately flows through the device's cannula into the subcutaneous tissue layer.  No medication is stored in the device (other than the small amount of dead-space in the medication channel within the device).\n\nAdvantages\n Reduces skin punctures\n Reduces fear and anxiety associated with multiple daily injections \n Reduces bruising around injection site\n Viable alternative to standard injections\n\nDisadvantages\n Injection ports must be obtained in addition to syringes and medication\n Ports are sometimes not covered by insurance\n Patient still has to administer shots\n\nModels\n\nInsuflon\nThe  Insuflon, manufactured and distributed by  Unomedical, is inserted at a 20-45° angle and rests flush against the skin similar to an IV.\n\nI-Port\nThe  I-Port, manufactured and distributed by  Patton Medical Devices, is a domed shaped device with a cannula inserted at a 90° angle.

{"topic": "Bio Suisse", "document": "Bio Suisse is the main organisation of organic agriculture in Switzerland. This umbrella organization counts 33 organic farmers' associations among its members, as well as the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL. It notably manages the guidelines of the organic label \"Bio Suisse\".\n\nIt was founded in 1981 and, as federation of the Swiss organic farmers, represents the interest of about 7,560 agricultural businesses (regularly inspected by independent bodies).Organic market share continues to grow (in german) It also certifies around 1300 processing companies.\n\nThe organic label \"Bio Suisse\" is widely distributed in Switzerland, for instance through organic food shops, farmers markets and the largest supermarkets chains: Coop Naturaplan and Migros Bio.\n\nAs of 2022, 17,4 percent of Swiss farms are organic and the organic market in Switzerland share to almost 11 percent. \n\nImports will be permitted only if domestic production is not possible (e.g. coffee), not sufficient (e.g. cereals) from Swiss Bud farmers or has already been sold. The products are processed mainly in Switzerland.\n\nFresh products from overseas are only permitted in exceptional cases (e.g. mangoes or bananas). Vegetables are sourced in Europe and/or from Mediterranean countries, even in winter. Imports by air are prohibited. Nearby foreign countries are preferred for imports.\n\nIn 2021, over 2’500 farms/producer groups abroad were certified to Bio Suisse regulations. Most of them are located in Europe. Cereals and animal feed are the products most commonly imported in terms of volume.\n\nIn 2023, Bio Suisse introduced the \"Bio Cuisine\" label. Bio Cuisine stands for more sustainability in gastronomy. \"Bio Cuisine\" identifies restaurants and businesses with a relevant proportion of Bud products.\n\nGuidelines and Certification \n\nThe Bio Suisse guidelines are based on the Organic Farming Ordinance, but go beyond it in many respects, such as plant protection, animal feed, processing and social standards. The \"Bud\", the Bio Suisse organic label stands for:\n\n Holistic - organic for the whole farm and for the whole product processing\n Biodiversity - diverse habitats for plants and animals\n Animal welfare - species-appropriate fodder, animal-friendly stable, plenty of exercise and pasture (tethered stables are permitted) if the animals can move regularly outdoors.\n Resource conservation - renunciation of chemical-synthetic pesticides and artificial fertilizers. Protection of soil, water, air and climate.\n Taste - gentle processing, free of aroma and colourings, authentic product\n Confidence - strict controls, renunciation of genetic engineering, strict regulations for imports\n Fairness - Guidelines for social requirements and  fair trade\n\nThe operations in Switzerland are inspected by the state-approved organic inspection bodies Bio.inspecta, Bio-Test Agro, Pro Cert or IMO.\n\nCompanies of foreign suppliers are inspected at the request of a licensee if he does not find the products in Switzerland or does not find them in sufficient quantity. These companies must comply with the Bio Suisse Organic guidelines, which are equivalent to the Bio Suisse guidelines for Switzerland; supplemented by some requirements such as sustainable water use in areas with scarce water resources. The annual inspections of the farms are carried out by accredited inspection bodies on site. On the basis of these inspection reports, the International Certification Bio Suisse (ICB AG) and bio.inspecta assess the conformity of the processes and practices of the farms with the requirements of Bio Suisse and issue a Bio Suisse Organic Certificate if fulfilled. This is the most important prerequisite for importing organic products into Switzerland for sale with the \"Bud\" label.\n\nRequirements for import \nThe Bio Suisse Standards differ from minimum governmental regulations in several important respects, e. g. those of the EU (see the information note Summary of the Bio Suisse Standards for producers outside of Switzerland).\n\nEspecially noteworthy are: The whole-farm approach, the establishment of areas dedicated to the enhancement of biodiversity, and rigorous limits on the intensity of fertilization and on the use of copper. As an importer of organic products to be marketed with the \"Bud\" a Swiss importer must hold a valid licence contract with Bio Suisse and the import licence for the corresponding products. Also the suppliers must be certified according to Bio Suisse Standards (throughout all levels of trade from cultivation to export). Furthermore, the provisions of the Swiss Ordinance on Organic Farming SR 910.18 must be complied with in any case.\nThese requirements are listed in detail in the Import manual, the guide for the import of organic products to be marketed with the \"Bud\".\n\nSee also \n Agriculture in Switzerland\n Environmental movement in Switzerland\n EU-Eco-regulation\n International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (member)\n Organic aquaculture\n Research Institute of Organic Agriculture\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Official website\n\nOrganic food certification organizations\nOrganic farming in Switzerland\nAgricultural organisations based in Switzerland\n1981 establishments in Switzerland\nOrganisations based in Basel", "instruction": " What specific countries do most of the 2,500 farms/producer groups abroad that are certified to Bio Suisse regulations come from?"}
{"topic": "History of professional baseball in Nashville, Tennessee", "document": "Nashville, Tennessee, has hosted Minor League Baseball (MiLB) teams since the late 19th century but has never been home to a Major League Baseball (MLB) team. The city's professional baseball history dates back to 1884 with the formation of the Nashville Americans, who were charter members of the original Southern League in 1885 and played their home games at Sulphur Spring Park, later renamed Athletic Park and Sulphur Dell. This ballpark was the home of Nashville's minor league teams through 1963. Of the numerous teams to play there, the best known was the Nashville Vols, who competed from 1901 to 1963, primarily in the Southern Association.\n\nFollowing the loss of the Vols and the subsequent demolition of Sulphur Dell, Music City was without a professional baseball team for 14 years until 1978 when the Nashville Sounds, then a Double-A team that moved up to Triple-A in 1985, began play at Herschel Greer Stadium. The Sounds left Greer in 2015 for First Tennessee Park, now known as First Horizon Park, a new facility built on the site of the historic Sulphur Dell, where they continue as the oldest active professional sports franchise in Nashville.\n\nSeveral Negro league teams were based in Nashville, playing at Sulphur Dell as well as Greenwood Park and Tom Wilson Park, from 1920 to 1951. Among these were the Nashville Elite Giants, who played 15 seasons in the city, including six seasons in leagues that were retroactively granted major league status by MLB in 2020.\n\nDespite efforts to bring Major League Baseball to Nashville, most prominently in the 1993 MLB expansion process, the city has been unsuccessful in its attempts to gain a major league team. An effort is being made to either land a future expansion team or lure an existing team to Nashville with the promise of a new major league facility.\n\nMinor League Baseball\n\nEarly teams (1884–1897)\n\nAmateur teams first played baseball in Nashville, Tennessee, in the late 1860s. On October 6, 1884, local investors met to establish the city's first professional baseball team, the Nashville Americans.  Following a failed bid to join the major league Union Association, the Americans instead became charter members of the original Southern League in which they competed in 1885 and 1886. They played their home games at Sulphur Spring Park, later renamed Athletic Park and Sulphur Dell.\n\nNashville's Southern League entry in 1887 was called the Nashville Blues. After losing nearly US$18,000, the team's directors chose to cut their losses and withdraw from the circuit some two months before the season's end. Nashville did not field another professional baseball club for the next five years until the Nashville Tigers joined the Southern League in 1893. The Tigers faced similar financial difficulties, resulting in the franchise being surrendered to the league, which continued to operate it for the remainder of their first season. Their 1894 campaign came to an abrupt midseason end on the heels of league-wide financial instability.\n\nThe Nashville Seraphs replaced the Tigers in 1895. At the close of the season, the Seraphs and Atlanta Crackers were tied for first place, and each asserted to be the rightful pennant winners. At the Southern League's annual winter meeting that December, nearly four months later, Nashville was declared the champion for 1895. Despite winning the city's first professional baseball title, the Seraphs declined to participate in 1896 when another club refused to put up its monetary guarantee to finish the season. Two years later, in 1897, the Nashville Centennials were formed as members of the Central League. Financial problems necessitated the team's transfer to Henderson, Kentucky, just over a month into the season, and the league collapsed shortly thereafter.\n\nVols (1901–1963)\n\nThe Nashville Vols, the city's longest-operating baseball team, played 62 seasons from 1901 to 1963. First known only as the Nashville Baseball Club, they were formed as a charter member of the newly organized Southern Association in 1901. The team did not receive its official moniker, the Nashville Volunteers (regularly shortened to Vols), until 1908. Their last season in the Southern Association was 1961. They were inactive in 1962 due to declining attendance and the Southern Association ceasing operations after the 1961 season. Nashville returned for a final campaign as a part of the South Atlantic League in 1963.\n\nToday, all Minor League Baseball teams are affiliated with a Major League Baseball team to develop players for the major league club. However, it was not until the 1930s that Nashville entered into such major league affiliations on a consistent basis. The Vols were affiliated with eight teams across 29 seasons and were unaffiliated in the other 33. Their longest affiliation was with the Chicago Cubs for nine seasons (1943–1951), followed by the Cincinnati Reds/Redlegs (8 seasons; 1936–1937, 1955–1960), New York Giants (5 seasons; 1934–1935, 1952–1954), Brooklyn Dodgers (3 seasons; 1938–1940), and one season each with the Cleveland Naps (1908), Minnesota Twins (1961), Chicago White Sox (1920), and Los Angeles Angels (1963). The Vols won eight Southern Association pennants (1901, 1902, 1908, 1916, 1940, 1943, 1948, 1949), nine playoff championships (1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1949, 1950, 1953), and four Dixie Series titles (1940, 1941, 1942, 1949).\n\nSounds (1978–present)\n\nMusic City was without a professional baseball team for 14 years after the loss of the Vols. That changed in 1978 when Larry Schmittou and a group of investors purchased the rights to operate an expansion franchise of the Double-A Southern League called the Nashville Sounds. The Sounds played their home games at Herschel Greer Stadium, a new ballpark located on the grounds of Fort Negley. Nashville led all of Minor League Baseball in attendance in their inaugural season and continued to draw the Southern League's largest crowds in each of their seven years as members of the league. The Sounds had affiliations with the Cincinnati Reds (1978–1979) and New York Yankees (1980–1984). The team won six consecutive second-half division titles from 1979 to 1984 and won the Southern League championship in 1979 and 1982.\n\nIn an effort to position Nashville to contend for an MLB franchise in the future, Schmittou and team owners purchased the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association and relocated the team to Nashville before the 1985 season. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded them. They rarely contended for the American Association championship, making only three appearances in the postseason over their 13 years in the league. During this period, Nashville was affiliated with the Detroit Tigers (1985–1986), Cincinnati Reds (1987–1992), and Chicago White Sox (1993–1997).\n\nThe Sounds became members of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998 following the dissolution of the American Association after the end of the previous season. They were affiliates of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1998–2004), Milwaukee Brewers (2005–2014), Oakland Athletics (2", "instruction": " What major league teams have had an affiliation with the Nashville Sounds since 1993?"}

{"topic": "Plano-convex ingot", "document": "Plano-convex ingots are lumps of metal with a flat or slightly concave top and a convex base. They are sometimes, misleadingly, referred to as bun ingots which imply the opposite concavity. They are most often made of copper, although other materials such as copper alloy, lead and tin are used. The first examples known were from the Near East during the 3rd and 2nd Millennia BC. By the end of the Bronze Age they were found throughout Europe  and in Western and South Asia. Similar ingot forms continued in use during later Roman and Medieval periods.\n\nManufacture\nTraditionally bun ingots were seen as a primary product of smelting, forming at the base of a furnace beneath a layer of less dense slag. However, experimental reconstruction of copper smelting showed that regular plano-convex ingots are difficult to form within the smelting furnace, producing only small ingots or copper prills that need to be remelted. High purity copper bun ingots found in Late Bronze Age Britain and the Mediterranean seem to have undergone a secondary refining procedure.\n\nThe metallographic structure and high iron compositions of some plano-convex ingots suggest that they are the product of primary smelting. Tylecote suggested that Roman plano-convex copper ingots may have been formed by tapping both slag and copper in one step into a mould or pit outside the furnace. A similar process was described by Agricola in book IX of his De Re Metallica and has been replicated experimentally.\n\nStructure\nAlthough all bun ingots share the same basic morphology, the details of their form and the texture of their convex base is dependent on the mould in which they cooled. Bun ingots made in purpose-dug depressions in sand can be highly variable in form even on the same site, whereas ingots cast in reusable moulds will form sets of identical “mould siblings”.\n\nThe composition of the metal and its cooling conditions affect structure. As the ingot cools gases are released giving the upper surface a “blistered” texture and if cooling takes place outside of the furnace, the outer surface often becomes oxidised. Casting in a warm mould or reheating furnace gives the ingot an even columnar structure running in the direction of cooling, whereas ingots cast in a cold mould have a distinctive two stage cooling structure with an outer chilled layer reflecting the rapid cooling of the bottom when it came into contact with the mould. A slightly concave upper surface can be produced if the top of the ingot cools more slowly than the bottom.\n\nBritain\n\nLate Bronze Age\nBy the Late Bronze Age, the copper bun ingot, either in a simple form or with a hole in its center, had become the main form of copper ingot, replacing the earlier ‘bar ingot’ or rippenbarre. Weights of complete examples average ~4 kg, but examples of up to about 7 kg are known. Many early finds of British LBA bun ingots were unstratified but recently bun-shaped ingots and ingot fragments have been found in hoards alongside bronze artifacts and scrap metal. Several offshore finds of probable LBA date suggest that copper bun ingots may have been traded by sea during this period.\n\nComposition and Structure \nThe copper is of high purity, although earlier examples are sometimes composed of arsenical copper. Tylecote suggested that they are not primary smelting products and instead were refined and recast. The macrostructure of a half section example from Gillan, Cornwall shows a columnar structure that probably indicates slow cooling in a reheating furnace or a warm mold, rather than from pouring into a cold mold.\n\nIron Age and Roman period\nA second major group of British bun ingots date to the Roman period and are found mostly in the copper-rich highland areas of Wales and in Scotland. They are heavier than the LBA examples, with weights ranging between 12 and 22 kg.\n\nSome have stamps clearly dating them to the Roman period including an example that reads SOCIO ROMAE NATSOL. The term \"socio\" suggests that the ingots were cast by a private company rather than by the state. Fraser Hunter reassessed the context of the Scottish examples and some of the unstamped Welsh examples and argues that they could in fact date to the Iron Age or at least reflect native rather than Roman copper working. Although ingots of any sort are not common in the British Iron Age, planoconvex or bun-shaped ingots exist, e.g. a tin ingot discovered within the Iron Age hillfort at Chun Castle, Cornwall.\n\nComposition and Structure of Roman Ingots \nThe Roman Bun Ingots are less pure than the earlier LBA examples and Tylecote suggests that they may be a direct product of smelting. Theoretically such an ingot could be formed in the base of the furnace. However, this is problematic in the case of the stamped examples as this would require the furnace to be dismantled or else have a short shaft to allow access for stamping. As a solution the furnace could have been tapped into a mould at the completion of smelting. It is possible that both methods were used as several of the ingots seem to have had additional metal poured onto the top in order to allow stamping.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n \n\nMetallurgy\nCasting (manufacturing)", "instruction": " What specific metallurgical processes were used to produce the varied structures observed in plano-convex ingots, particularly the difference between those with a columnar structure and those with a two-stage cooling structure?"}

{"topic": "Fish (singer)", "document": "Derek William Dick (born 25 April 1958), better known by his stage name Fish, is a Scottish singer-songwriter and occasional actor.\n\nFish became widely known as the lead singer and lyricist of the neo-progressive rock band Marillion from 1981 until 1988. He released 11 UK Top 40 singles with the band, including the Top Ten singles \"Kayleigh\", \"Lavender\" and \"Incommunicado\", and five Top Ten albums, including a number one with Misplaced Childhood. In his solo career, Fish explored contemporary pop and traditional folk, and released a further five Top 40 singles and a Top 10 album.\n\nFish's voice has been described as both \"distinct\" and a \"conflation of Roger Daltrey and Peter Gabriel\", while his lyrics have been described as \"poetic prose\". In 2004, Classic Rock ranked Fish at number 49 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Frontmen\", describing his \"theatrical delivery\" as \"a major factor in Marillion's spectacular rise, and he masterminded some uniquely ornate lyrical concepts.\" In 2009, Fish was voted at number 37 in a poll of the greatest voices in rock music by Planet Rock listeners.\n\nIn 2020, Fish released his final studio album Weltschmerz (German for \"world-weariness\"), to critical acclaim and commercial success. Fish toured Weltschmerz and celebrated the 30th anniversary of A Vigil In A Wilderness of Mirrors as part of the Vigil's End tour in 2021. Fish plans to retire following a farewell tour in 2024.\n\nEarly life\nDerek William Dick was born on 25 April 1958 in Edinburgh, Scotland, and grew up in Dalkeith. The son of Robert and Isabella, Fish was educated at King's Park primary school and then Dalkeith High School. He was inspired by the music of many of the rock artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Genesis, Pink Floyd, the Moody Blues, the Kinks, T. Rex, David Bowie, Argent, and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band (Fish would later pay tribute to these early influences on his covers album Songs from the Mirror). Fish has also cited Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell as \"one of the biggest influences on me because of her approach to lyrics\". The first band he saw live was Yes at Usher Hall, Edinburgh, in 1974. As well as his love for music, he was also a voracious reader, and his literary inspirations included Jack Kerouac, Truman Capote, Robert Burns and Dylan Thomas (all of whom would later be depicted on the sleeve of Marillion's Clutching at Straws).\n\nFish worked as a petrol pump attendant, gardener, and from 1977 until 1980 worked in forestry at the Bowhill Estate in Selkirk. While living in Fochabers, Moray he adopted the nickname of Fish, which originated from a landlord who lamented the amount of time he spent in the bath. Fish has been quoted: \"With a real name of Derek William Dick, it became very necessary to find a nickname as quickly as possible.\" \n\nHe first performed as a singer in 1980: \"The very first gig I ever did as a singer was in Gala [Galashiels] in the Golden Lion pub.\" He moved to Church Laneham, Nottinghamshire, in mid-1980 following a successful audition for the Stone Dome Band, and then to Aylesbury at the start of 1981 in the process of joining Marillion.\n\nMarillion\n\nFish joined Marillion in 1981. The band gained popularity over the next couple of years, leading to the release of their top-ten debut album Script for a Jester's Tear in 1983. They achieved further chart success in the UK, attaining top-ten hit singles in 1985 with \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\", and again in 1987 with \"Incommunicado\". In 1988, due to the stress of touring and the detrimental effect it was having on his health, as well as having a falling out with bandmate Steve Rothery,\nFish left Marillion to pursue a solo career.\nLyrics from \"Kayleigh\" were etched into paving stones in Market Square in Galashiels in 2012. The lines \"stilettoes in the snow\", and \"moon-washed college halls\" were inspired by Fish's girlfriend of the time, who was at the Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels in the 1980s.\n\nSolo career\nFish’s debut solo album Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors was released in January 1990. Although the recordings for the album finished in June 1989, EMI Records decided to delay the release until 1990, to avoid collision with Marillion's album Seasons End, released in September 1989. Keyboardist Mickey Simmonds who had played with Mike Oldfield, co-wrote the songs on the album, and would continue to play with Fish on the tour. Also guitarist Janick Gers co-wrote the track \"View From the Hill\". Several well known musicians contributed to the album, including former Dire Straits guitarist Hal Lindes, who played guitar on most tracks and also contributed to the writing of three of the album’s songs. Frank Usher, a Fish companion from pre-Marillion times, also contributed. Drums were played by Mark Brzezicki (Big Country) and John Keeble (Spandau Ballet), John Giblin contributed bass and Luís Jardim contributed additional percussion. Backing vocals came from Tessa Niles, who had appeared on Clutching at Straws. \n\nMany of Fish's later works contain lengthy spoken-word lyrics, shorter examples of which can be heard on earlier Marillion albums. He has collaborated with Genesis founder Tony Banks on Banks's Still and Soundtracks albums, singing on the tracks \"Shortcut to Somewhere\", \"Angel Face\" and \"Another Murder of a Day\", co-writing the latter.\n\nHis solo career has never received the same recognition or attention, and to a lot of people he went missing soon after the Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors album, in February 1990, the album peaked at number 5 in the UK Albums Chart. After finishing the Vigil World Tour at Royal Albert Hall on 9 July 1990, Fish was to enter litigation with EMI records resulting in a High Court injuction that stopped him releasing new music for almost a year. The extensive touring cost him dearly and the decision to go ahead with building a new studio in his home in Haddington Scotland meant that funds were rapidly depleted along with his confidence and his creative energies. \n\nThe prospect of writing the follow-up for the new label, Polydor, filled him with dread. His second album Internal Exile released in October 1991, was flirting with styles but never got into a particular groove and locking into a direction. The album's music reflected Fish's indulgence in the vast regions of music that he wanted to explore as a solo artist; most notably Celtic music and folk styles. The acquisition of Chris Kimsey as producer could not save the project as he attempted to come to terms with a newly built studio and Fish plauged by bitterness and cynicism toward the industry. Polydor had rushed the album out with his acquiesence resulted in a fractured promotion campaign and low sales, and the UK promoter went bankrupt just as the tour was about to kick off. \n\nPolydor wanted a new studio album but Fish persisted and he decided to release an album of cover versions called Songs from the Mirror. Produced by James Cassidy, whom Fish met while both were working on Jeff Waynes Spartacus album. They started recording in summer 1992 while simultaneously writing material for the next studio album Suits, a cynical examination lyrically of the music business and executives who still fed Fish's cynical outlook on life. Songs from the Mirror, released in January 1993, became the last album on Polydor. But the album was a turning point for Fish, and fully prepared him for the Suits sessions, material which he had been rehearsing constantly on tour as he struggled to pay bills and musicians. Fish formed his own record company, Dick Bros. after advice from a medium who passed on messages from his grandfather.

SB 946 states a vendor can be a “roaming sidewalk vendor”, which is someone who moves around to vend, or a “stationary vendor”, someone who just stays in one place to vend. SB 946 applies to charter cities in terms of local authority.\n\nThe purpose of SB 946 is to let local law enforcement not fine or regulate street vendors where sidewalk traffic is light and is not infringing upon activity within the area. If local authorities wish to regulate sidewalk vending, they have to be consistent with SB 946. If a city does not have any sidewalk vending legislations and wishes to implement new ones, they also have to be consistent with SB 946. If local authorities have regulations that are consistent with SB 946, no further action is needed. If they have regulations that are not consistent with SB 946, adjustments to these laws will have to be adjusted.\n\nAny sidewalk vending regulations that are adopted or enforced by local authority must follow specific standards\n\n\"SB 946 also imposes time, place, and manner restrictions on sidewalk street vending.\"\n\nA local authority is not required to enforce all or some of these restrictions. If any additional restrictions other than the ones above are to be enforced, it must be directly related to objective health, safety, or welfare concerns.\n\n\"SB 946 allows but does not require a permitting program for local sidewalk vendors.\" These programs must accept specific ID documents  in lieu of a social security number. The collected number is confidential.\n\nSB 946 does not limit or affect any state food safety laws, including the California retail food code.\n\nSB 946 does not allow any criminal charges, but may allow administrative fines. A violation of the local authority's vending programs is only punishable by the following fines: $100 for the first violation, $200 for the second violation, and $500 for any additional violation within one year of the first violation. If the local authority requires a vending program, the authorities can impose higher fines for vending without a permit: $250 for the first violation, $500 for the second violation, and $1000 for any additional violation within one year of the first violation. On the fourth and any subsequent violation, the local authority can rescind a permit.\n\nSB 946 applies to any pending criminal charges or vindicates any prior convictions.\n\nControversy\n\nVendor Cooperation \nWhile the intent of SB 946 is to aid in the “important entrepreneurship and economic development opportunities” street vending may bring to low-income and immigrant communities, the inability to prosecute vendors with criminal charges has led to issues surrounding vendor cooperation. Despite the passing of city ordinances that require vendors to receive permits and follow certain regulations, some vendors “have chosen to ignore these regulations and bypass the permitting program”. A lack of vendor cooperation has led some cities to create stricter ordinances in hopes of gaining compliance through larger fines, relocations, or confiscation of “stalls and wares”.\n\nHealth Permit \nIn many California cities, the permitting process required of vendors may also include receiving a food handler health permit, a document certifying the safe preparation of food by vendors. Outdated state retail food code however has caused issues for vendors seeking to comply with these regulations. In an effort to solve this issue, Senate Bill 972 was passed by the California Senate in order to update the food code to simplify the requirements for street vendors. Specifically, the bill introduces street vending into the food code and limits the equipment requirements originally established for food trucks.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\n</ref>\n\nStreet vendors\nCalifornia statutes", "instruction": " What specific health and safety regulations must stationary and roaming sidewalk vendors comply with under the Safe Sidewalk Vending Act?"}

Sunk in the late 1860s, it was linked to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Burnley to Todmorden line which became known as the Copy Pit route and, by tramway, to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.\n\nTowneley Colliery was sunk next to Brooks and Pickup's fireclay works less than a half mile from Towneley railway station which served Towneley Hall. Brooks and Pickup began coal production from the main shaft, the Alice Pit in late February 1869. For 75 years coal was extracted from the Arley, Dandy, King and Yard mines.  The colliery had sidings on either side of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Burnley to Todmorden line, the Copy Pit route. A half-mile long tramway linking it to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal had four tunnels. Boggart Brig Pit beside the A671 Todmorden Road was linked by a tramroad and was also linked underground. The pit was also linked underground to Bank Hall Colliery a half mile distant.\n\nIn 1923 the colliery was owned by Brooks & Brooks Collieries and employed 770 men working the colliery which included the Towneley Drift. In 1933 the Towneley Coal & Fireclay Company employed 672 men, 480 of them underground. The colliery produced fireclay as well as coal used for household and manufacturing use, coking and for producing gas.\n   \nThe colliery was nationalised in 1947 after which the National Coal Board worked the Yard, Dandy and Lower Mountain mines. Its satellite pits, Dyneley Knoll (), Boggart Brig () and Park Pits () closed in 1947 and were abandoned in 1949. The colliery closed on 6 March 1949. Its shafts were used for pumping until 1971 when Bank Hall Colliery closed. Little remains of the colliery, a residential development occupies a small part of the site and the rest comprises steep, mossy hillocks and woodland. A small replica brick kiln was built on a hillock to commemorate the colliery's brickworks.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nCoal mines in Lancashire\nMining in Lancashire\nUnderground mines in England\nBuildings and structures in Burnley\nHistory of Burnley Borough", "instruction": " What specific mining techniques were used at Towneley Colliery during its operational period?"}
{"topic": "Banggwijaengi myeoneuri", "document": "Banggwijaengi myeoneuri (방귀쟁이 며느리 The Farting Daughter-in-law) is an orally transmitted Korean folk tale. \n\nIt is the story of a Korean woman who produces loud destructive farts.  When one fart severely damages her husband's house, his family throws her out.  However, her flatulence later proves beneficial to the family and she is welcomed back..\n\nHistory and transmission \nBanggwijaengi myeoneuri is recorded in almost 100 different versions in key oral tale collections including Hanguk gubi munhak daegye [한국구비문학대계 Outlines of Korean Oral Literature]. It is told throughout the Korean Peninsula.\n\nPlot\n\nBasic plot \nIn a household long ago, the daughter-in-law looked sick and was growing thinner. When her in-laws got worried asked her what was wrong, she answered that it was because she could not fart. When they heard this, her mother- and father-in-law told her not to worry and urged her to fart freely. The daughter-in-law answered that her farts were extremely powerful. She urged the family to prepare thoroughly, telling her father-in-law to hold on to a column, her mother-in-law to the door, her husband to the kitchen door, and her sister-in-law to the rice pot. When she farted, it was so powerful that the house was badly damaged, with some parts flying off and other parts collapsing.\n\nWhen they saw the strength of her fart, her parents-in-law decided to send her back to her original family. She followed her father-in-law back there. On the way, they met a peddler. The daughter-in-law made a bet with him that she could pick some fruit from a tree. She got the fruit down by doing an enormous fart and received a good item from the peddler in return. When he saw this, her father-in-law realized that his daughter-in-law’s farts were useful and took her back to his house.\n\nVariations \nVariations on Banggwijaengi myeoneuri are broadly as follows. \n\nFirst are those variations where the story finishes when the daughter-in-law does a huge fart. Second are variations in which the fart blows away either just the parents-in-law or the parents-in-law and the husband, widowing the protagonist. Third are variations in which the story ends with the daughter-in-law being kicked out by her in-laws for farting. Fourthly are variations in which, instead of meeting a peddler on the way back to her blood family, the daughter-in-law farts to knock down some pears or daechu (jujubes) from high up in a tree for her father-in-law after he expresses a desire to eat them, then returns to her husband’s home. Finally, the wares sold by the peddler differ in some versions, with variations including brassware, silk, hemp cloth, sundries or wooden bowls.\n\nFeatures and significance \nBanggwijaengi myeoneuri is a folk tale but has mythical qualities. Firstly, the daughter-in-law, with farts powerful enough to send houses and people flying and strip fruit from high branches, resembles a female giant in a myth. The resounding farts she emits can be seen as an inheritance from excremental motifs in giant tales; among the various types of excretion, farting is one that induces particular mirth. Moreover, the way the daughter-in-law is expelled from her in-laws’ home before returning again can be seen as a kind of “rite of passage” whereby a daughter-in-law gains the acceptance of her husband’s family.\n\nOther \nBanggwijaengi myeoneuri is a type of “farter tale.” Such comedic tales include not only Banggwijaengi myeoneuri, with its flatulent daughter-in-law protagonist, but various other stories including those about competitions among farters, and those in which thieves are chased away by farts.\n\nReferences \n\nhttps://gubi.aks.ac.kr/web/VolView2_html5.asp?datacode=02_29_FOT_20150124_KJO_HHS_0003\nhttps://gubi.aks.ac.kr/web/VolView1_html5.asp?ur10no=tsu_0311&ur20no=Q_0311_1_F_008\n“Banggwijaengi myeoneuri” (방귀쟁이 며느리 The Farting Daughter-in-law), Hanguk gubi munhak daegye [한국구비문학대계 Outlines of Korean Oral Literature], https://gubi.aks.ac.kr/web/VolView1_html5.asp?ur10no=tsu_0781&ur20no=Q_0781_1_F_020\n\nKorean folklore", "instruction": " What are some common objects or items that the peddler sells in variations of the Banggwijaengi myeoneuri tale?"}
{"topic": "Before You Go (film)", "document": "Before You Go is a 2002 comedy film directed by Lewis Gilbert (his final directorial effort).  The imperfect lives of three sisters are revealed at their unloved mother's funeral.\n\nPlot\nThree sisters, Teresa, Mary and Catherine grew up on The Isle of Man, where their mother Violet has died. Teresa and her husband Frank live there, and they have been looking after her. They summon the other two sisters to return for the funeral.\n\nTeresa and Frank have a local vitamin and supplements business. He is her second husband, and is similar to their uncommunicative father. She constantly reminds her sisters that she and Frank have regularly helped their mother without their aid.\n\nMary, a doctor, has been having a long-term affair with fellow physician Mike, who is married with children. Catherine hasn’t fared much better, presently dating a Spaniard,  Javier.\n\nMary has been placed by Teresa in their deceased mum’s bedroom. She regularly has visions and flashbacks of her while they are organising and preparing the funeral. Mary is searching for a box in the house that has a few of her things, but Teresa insists that she hasn’t seen it.\n\nCatherine is shown to be flighty and her sisters don’t take her seriously. She lives beyond her means—even though she’s in debt, she constantly buys on credit. She also is always looking for a fix. Catherine periodically pretends to faint etc to get attention. And finally, they never remember her ‘boyfriend’ or ‘fiancé’s’ name because she is constantly changing partners.\n\nEvery time the phone rings, all three jump for it, until Frank and Mike turn up. Mary sisters meet Mike and recognise him for a regular spot on the BBC on medicine that he presents. Mary throws herself to her knees, and after having besought him to medicate her, she insists that she is in grief, although earlier in the film she showed indifference to her mother’s death. The next morning, Mary and Mike have a sexual interlude in the woods. Afterwards, she tells him she thinks she’s pregnant, but discovers he had a vasectomy years ago. They head back to the house, where Teresa and Catherine have benn drinking the liquor that they found as they sort out their mother's clothes to give away. They dance and frolic in her fancy dresses.\n\nFrank finally arrives. After meeting Mike, he goes down to the pub with Teresa. She asks if he’s been having an affair, only to find out he wants to quit selling supplements. Instead he wants to buy and run a pub, which angers her. Teresa concludes he hasn’t been upfront their whole relationship.\n\nWhen Frank and Teresa get back, everyone witnesses Catherine being dumped on the phone by Javier. In tears she says how lonely she is, explaining she gets taken advantage of, having slept with 78 different men to date. Later on, when Frank is trying to rest Catherine tries to get his sympathy, and makes a pass.\n\nThe two couples walk into town to the pub. After some whisky, Teresa very loudly embarrasses them all. On their return, she talks about Mary’s teenage pregnancy, which no one else there knew about. Mike and Mary talk, and she reveals that the container she’s seeking contains the birth certificate for the child, Patrick. She’s hoping to make herself accessible in case her now-adult son wanted contact. Mike makes it clear he doesn’t want any more children.\n\nIn the middle of the night Violet guides Mary to seek the tin in the garage. Teresa finds her and takes it, as she doesn't want her to see all the contents until the funeral the next day. Upon her insistence for details, it is revealed that Patrick died at 13 falling from a cliff.  \n \nMary had remembered her mother as brutal who, rather than stand by her when she became pregnant at 14, shouted at her and slapped her. She had held that moment in her mind, which had festered over the years until she hated her. But her memory plays tricks on her and it is not until finding the clipping that she remembers after the slap she had embraced and supported her.\n\nCast\n\nJulie Walters as Teresa\nJohn Hannah as Mike\nJoanne Whalley as Mary\nVictoria Hamilton as Catherine\nTom Wilkinson as Frank\nPatricia Hodge as Mother\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\n2002 films\nFilms directed by Lewis Gilbert\nBritish comedy films\n2002 comedy films\n2000s English-language films\n2000s British films\nEnglish-language comedy films", "instruction": " What significant event from Mary's past does she discover in the container she was searching for?"}
{"topic": "City of Bohane", "document": "City of Bohane  is the debut novel by Ireland's Kevin Barry. The book is set in the year 2053, in a world with minimal technology.  It received largely positive reviews and won the 2013 International Dublin Literary Award.\n\nSynopsis\nCity of Bohane is set in west Ireland in 2053. It features a world with minimal laws and technology where feuding gangs compete for control of the city of Bohane. There is public transit in the form of trams, but no cars. Characters write letters rather than phone and music is broadcast on wind up radios. Characters dress in flamboyant clothes and talk in an invented dialect. Barry describes it as a \"demented malevolent\" world inspired by what \"homicidal teenage hipsters\" might sound like in 40 years.  \"It's written in Technicolor,\" he explains. \"It's intended to be a big, visceral entertainment as well as a serious language experiment.\"\n\nThe book is influenced by American television, featuring short chapters and \"an awful lot\" of dialogue. \"There's no question that the best long-form fiction being written now is probably in American television,\" explains Barry. \"Maybe it's time novels started stealing something back [from television].\" The geography of the fictional Bohane is based on Porto, Portugal where Barry was holidaying when he got the idea for the novel.\n\nCity of Bohane tracks the lives of the Hartnett Fancy gang which controls most of Bohane. Logan Hartnett runs the family, but is heavily influenced by his 90-year-old mother. A feud between the Hartnett family and the Cusack family begins when a Cusack gets \"reefed\" (stabbed).  Reinforcements arrive and the feud turns into an all out battle for control of the city.\n\nReception\nWriting for The Guardian, Scarlett Thomas said City of Bohane shows Barry is a \"writer of great promise.\" She says he \"is a great storyteller\", and calls the novel's twists and turns \"satisfying, if, in places, familiar\". The characters have all different voices, she says. Thomas called the novel's plot and Barry's invented vernacular \"a wonderful blend of past, present and imagined future.\"\n\nA review published in Metro called City of Bohane an \"exuberant, spine-tinglingly atmospheric creation\". The novel has a variety of influences and is \"a highly entertaining place to lose yourself in,\" writes the Metro reviewer. \"The Bohane lingo takes a little while to settle into but it's worth the work,\" he adds.\n\nOn November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed City of Bohane on its list of the 100 \"most inspiring\" novels.\n\nAwards\nCity of Bohane won the prestigious International Dublin Literary Award in 2013. \"Kevin Barry's Ireland of 2053 is a place you may not want to be alive in, but you'll certainly relish reading about,\" remarked the judging panel.  City of Bohane beat out 153 other titles nominated by libraries around the world for the prize.  The International Dublin Literary Award is open to novels from any country that were written in English, or have been translated into it. The ten finalists for the award came from eight countries. Five of the ten were first published in a language other than English. The award carries a €100,000 prize, making it one of the richest literary prizes in the world.\n\nBarry became the third Irish author to win the prize, joining Colm Toibin who won in 2006 with The Master and Colum McCann who won in 2011 with Let the Great World Spin.  \"The fact that this award originates with the libraries is what makes it very special for me,\" remarked Barry. He said he has no plans to spend the money.  As a writer, he explains, \"you have good years and lean years. This award makes it a good year. It buys you a lot of time to be sitting at your desk, inventing deranged little worlds. It allows you to keep going – that's the definition of success for a writer.\" Lord Mayor of Dublin and award patron, Naoise Ó Muirí remarked \"I'm thrilled to see an Irish author of such immense talent take home this year's award.\"\n\nCity of Bohane also won the Authors' Club First Novel Award in 2012, and was shortlisted in the First Novel category at the 2011 Costa Book Awards.\n\nReferences\n\n2011 Irish novels\nFiction set in 2053\nIrish fantasy novels\nNovels set in Ireland\nWorks by Kevin Barry (author)\n2011 debut novels\nJonathan Cape books", "instruction": " What influential works of American television did Kevin Barry draw inspiration from when writing City of Bohane?"}

{"topic": "Birmingham School of Jewellery", "document": "Birmingham School of Jewellery, founded in 1890, is a jewellery school in Birmingham, England. Located on Vittoria Street in the city's Jewellery Quarter, it is the largest jewellery school in Europe. It is part of the Arts, Design and Media Faculty (ADM), a faculty of Birmingham City University.\n\nIts portfolio of courses includes jewellery, silversmithing, horology, and gemmology. The School also houses the Jewellery Industry Innovation Centre (JIIC), which offers professional expertise in industry-related techniques including Computer Aided Design (CAD), rapid prototyping and surface finishing.\n\nHistory\nBy the mid-19th century, the jewellery trade was considered the most lucrative in Birmingham with jewellers being some of the best paid workers in the city. There were also more people employed in the trade than any other in the city. Apprentices generally did not require any qualifications but style became a study within the industry and one jeweller's firm required all apprentices to attend the Birmingham School of Art.\n\nThe Birmingham School of Jewellery and Silversmithing was established in 1890 as a branch of the School of Art when Martin & Chamberlain converted a goldsmith's factory, built in 1865 to a design by J. G. Bland. The top storey was added in 1906 by Cossins, Peacock & Bewlay who also designed the south extension in 1911. The school was acquired by Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University) in 1989, along with an adjoining site.\n\nThe university commissioned Associated Architects who designed a further south extension which was constructed between 1992 and 1993. They also redesigned much of the interior, creating a full-height atrium with gallery access to workshops. The reception area can also be used as exhibition space. The building itself consists of a Lombardo-Gothic front, whilst the 1911 extension is of red brick mottled with blue. The project won the 1995 RIBA Architecture Award and the 1996 Civic Trust Award.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n BCU website\n\n1890 establishments in England\nJewellery\nEducation in Birmingham, West Midlands\nEducational institutions established in 1890\nJewellery industry in the United Kingdom\nRecipients of Civic Trust Awards", "instruction": " What notable figures have attended or taught at the Birmingham School of Jewellery throughout its history?"}
